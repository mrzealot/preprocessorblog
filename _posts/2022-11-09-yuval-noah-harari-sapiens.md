It's no secret that my initial goal with this blog is to create a broad and diverse "base", from which we can follow the millions of emerging threads and cover... Well, just about everything. So besides philosophy and psychology, I thought it's time we scheduled a bit of history as well. In doing so, we are both following the advice given in [Flow]({% post_url 2022-10-26-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi-flow %}) and also continuing the line of historical examples from [48 laws]({% post_url 2022-11-04-robert-greene-the-48-laws-of-power %}). Of course, it doesn't hurt either that this particular book is recommended practically everywhere.

But first, let me go on the record: personally, I've always openly and loudly hated history as a subject in school. To be fair, I didn't "love" anything else beyond the maths / English / computer science triumvirate, but history stood out even from the rest. I honestly want to reexamine this prejudice of mine, though. What if my hating it was more the school system's fault -- or my immature, idiot little head's -- and not history's? After all, I didn't have a much better opinion of philosophy either until [Marcus Aurelius]({% post_url 2022-10-21-marcus-aurelius-meditations %}) fundamentally changed my attitude...

So it was in this mood, and with a forcefully open mind, that I started reading [Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens){:target="_blank"}, and boy was it worth it. It's a huge improvement in itself that I don't have to write a who-what-when fact checking test afterwards, true; but what *really* counts is the abstract, elevated perspective of events and the exploration of background connections. The topic we cover is nothing less than the entire evolution of the human race, which we trace back to the effects of 3 great revolutions:

1. [The cognitive revolution](#cognitive) -- or how we went from animals to cavemen;
2. [The agricultural revolution](#agricultural) -- or how we went from cavemen to "modern" humans;
    - A bonus 2.5th section is [the unification of humanity](#unification) -- or how we went from many isolated groups of people to one big, global nation; and finally<br>
3. [The scientific revolution](#scientific) -- or how went from mere humans to actual gods.

All the while, we discover trends, get to know ourselves better and, hopefully, learn from our mistakes.

<br>

















## <a name="cognitive"></a>The cognitive revolution

At the beginning, Homo Sapiens wasn't a particularly big deal. Our brains were grossly large -- triple the size of other animals already, which have since doubled -- but that alone is not a guaranteed survival strategy.

> A chimpanzee can't win an argument with a Homo sapiens, but the ape can rip the man apart like a rag doll.

Our other specialty is walking on two legs, which might be good for the development of our hands -- and the resulting use of tools -- but it's less fortunate for our spines. And for women, it's especially wonderful that their pelvis is shrinking just when their children's head sizes are growing along with their brains. No surprise, then, that we're born relatively "premature" and that there's so much emphasis on socializing to care for helpless children.

But despite all this, for 2 million years or so we've been stuck in the middle of the food chain, and even harnessing fire hasn't significantly dislodged us. Yet, something very fishy must have started around 70,000 years ago, because during the following 60,000 years, all other humanoid species became extinct. Some would explain this by mergers or other unrelated factors, but let's look in the mirror, people:

> Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark.

Harari posits that our sudden diversity is due to nothing more than a "cognitive explosion": our linguistic abilities have simply outstripped their competitors over time. The greater expressive power allowed for a more precise flow of information for one, and the social "gossip" factor that held groups together also made a big difference. But the most important part was fiction -- the ability to talk about (and believe in) things that didn't actually exist!

The emergence of shared beliefs allowed larger and larger masses of people to work together. And we aren't necessarily talking about religion here -- just think of concepts like nationalities, laws, money, or human rights.

> No one was lying when, in 2011, the UN demanded that the Libyan government respect the human rights of its citizens, even though the UN, Libya and human rights are all figments of our fertile imaginations.

It's an interesting contrast that modernity views Druids who gather for a full moon séance as primitive idiots, without realizing that the institutions of the modern world operate on exactly the same principle. A successful businessman is actually a shaman, only he says even stranger things. Strangers could easily cooperate through imaginary myths, and this opened up a "cultural fast lane" where we could overtake those who were moving at a slow, evolutionary pace. The chimps can't just switch to democracy after unseating the current alpha male... But we can.

<br>

It's difficult to say anything concrete about the lifestyle of this era without actual evidence, but it is worth trying on some level, because underneath the thin layer of civilization, the same software is still running in our heads today. Food hoarders, for example, instinctively gorged themselves if they had the opportunity, because who knew how long it would last; no wonder we need to diet so much in the age of plenty. Family and sexuality tended to be more communal things, in an "everybody with/for everybody" kind of way; so no wonder either that we need so many psychologists in the age of monogamy.

Groups of a few dozen to a few hundred enabled close cooperation, and frequent migrations were necessary for gathering. Instead of specialization, general knowledge -- and considerable physical fitness -- was needed to survive. In terms of religion, *animism* was predominant, i.e., roughly everything had a soul, there was no hierarchy in the world, and communication was free-flowing. Theories more detailed than this are mostly just introducing our own, current views into the very little evidence.

<br>

Another major breakthrough of the era was that we were finally able to leave the Afro-Asian continent. First we spread to Australia, then -- via Siberia, on foot -- to the Americas, and then, one after the other, we reached about every nook and cranny of the world, using the same playbook each time. Evolution failed to keep up with us, so we could upset the local ecosystems and drive half the flora and fauna to extinction. This was the first extermination, which we've already repeated since with the domestication of the agricultural revolution. If people more acutely aware of this, they might give more of a fuck about the third round, which we are performing right now.

<br>






















## <a name="agricultural"></a>The agricultural revolution

Hunting and gathering was 'in vogue' until about 10,000 years ago, which is when we started to focus a lot of our attention on just a few select plants and animals. We still don't really understand the ecological context of the world today -- let alone back then -- but sure, let's just mess with stuff. What could go wrong?

It's a common story that man, as he became more intelligent, finally conquered nature to make a better life for himself. To be fair, this change really did make more food available to mankind as a species. But at the same time, the average farmer worked harder and ate worse in return. Umm... What?!

> These plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice versa.

The negatives could go on and on: these plants needed a proper environment, weeding, nutrients, irrigation, and protection; they didn't make our diet better in any sense; cultivating them was bad for our physique; they didn't give us more security (in fact, they just made us more dependent on something); and they didn't give us more protection against aggression either (in fact, private property just made it potentially worse). Yet the only positive we can list is that more human specimens could exist at the same time. Period.

Of course, individuals wouldn't have gone along with this change just because it was "good" for the species. But, unfortunately for us, every step on the road to this point seemed like a good idea in itself at the time.

- Wheat is part of our diet, so we bring it back to the camp to process &#8658; Whoops, some seeds falls off, and next year there's wheat on the trail.

- Well then, why don't we just spread it where we want it? &#8658; Next year there's even more wheat, but there's still plenty of other stuff as well.

- So why don't we spend some time here every year for harvesting? &#8658; There's more and more wheat, but now time becomes the bottleneck.

- So why don't we settle here permanently? &#8658; There's even more wheat, but not much else now.

- Well then, why don't we save some of it, so that we can sow better &#8658; There'll be more.

- Well then, why don't we improve our techniques (deep sowing, weeding, tools, etc.) &#8658; There'll be more.

- Well then, why not have more children if there is enough food &#8658; we quickly use up the food surplus, and now we need even more food!

- Well then, let's work and build walls so that others don't take our wheat from us &#8658; Even more work for even more of us!

By the time we realized that this was a shitty deal, it was too late.

For one, we didn't even remember how it used to be by this time.
Also, there were already too many of us to make the old ways work, even if we remembered them.
Anyone who might be starting to suspect that we're committing the exact same mistake today has gained a very depressing realization: yes, we are committing the exact same mistake today. We invent a lot of things to save time, and still end up with less time... Genius!

> One of history's few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations.

<br>

This has been accompanied by a psychological revolution, where "our territory" has increasingly become "my house" and we've turned from the present more towards the future. However, long-term planning rarely worked out well for the peasants, as an "elite class" always coalesced who then skimmed off the surplus so that they can freely play at politics, wage wars, make art or philosophize. And for the ever greater cooperation, shared myths became increasingly more important. Of course, let's not forget that "cooperation" was also the end justifying slavery as a means.

As an example, we compare Hammurabi's Code with the American Declaration of Independence. To say that they have quite a different approach to human rights is an understatement, but nevertheless, they both claim to contain general, universal truths. Resolving the apparent contradiction is awkward, but simple: neither of them contains universal truths. Both are just stories we tell ourselves.

But if we want people to believe in an imaginary system, rule one is probably not mentioning that the system is imaginary in the first place! If we keep our mouths shut, however, then even society will help us instill the system in newcomers. In principle, our desires and tastes are shaped by the dominant beliefs of the time (there is nothing natural about, for example, holidaying abroad). Such imaginary systems are *inter-subjective*, that is, they exist solely because many people believe in them. And the only way to overturn one is to put something else -- something stronger -- in its place.

> There is no way out of the imagined order. When we break down our prison walls and run towards freedom, we are in fact running into the more spacious exercise yard of a bigger prison.

<br>

Since almost everything we do is based on imaginary stories, it would do us no harm to remember them - which, after a while, cannot be scaled. The evolution of our brains has been about observing plants, animals, our environment and social relationships. Raw data storage, essential for serious cooperation, is not - which is why the larger systems have all collapsed. This was the case until 5,000 years ago, when the Sumerians discovered an extra-brain data storage system: writing.

We had to modify our human 'holistic', free-association thinking to make it a bit more 'mechanical', but it was the way to record transactions, taxes and such. It also paved the way for Arabic numerals, which, together with a few operation signs, gave us a very expressive and logical language. Of these, only the 0 and the 1 matter most today, but they are more important than anything else.

<br>

Hierarchical constraints always appear in society, just always in a different way - which shows that there is nothing 'natural' about them, they were just invented. Maybe it's not fashionable today to restrict by race, "a black person can't live here"... But interestingly enough, we don't find it strange that there are neighbourhoods where "only rich people can live". Anyway, in big collaborations you need social cues, how to treat who, who is where in the hierarchy compared to the other, etc.

Let's just be careful to keep the "just the way it is" part well hidden from public view, lest the servants accidentally slit our throats at night. The American slaves, for example, have a perfectly logical, economic explanation why it was worthwhile for the traders to "import" them from Africa, but they also wanted to wash their hands. So they made up a lot of nonsense about "negros" not being intelligent or moral, unclean, spreading diseases, coming from a different religious lineage, being cursed with this fate, etc. And these "fairy tales" unfortunately persisted in people's minds long after slavery was abolished.

This is how heart-warming vicious cycles have developed, such as when you don't get a respectable job because you belong to a despised social class; and your social class is looked down upon because almost no one from that class has a respectable job... This is by no means a unique case: the power relations created by random historical events often lead to an unjust world order that becomes self-reinforcing over time. This is one of the reasons why history is worth studying, because biology does not explain the huge gaps between groups of people.

A good rule of thumb for discovering such is that "biology enables, culture disables". In the vernacular, we interpret 'natural' in terms of culture, which is why we can talk so much about what is not natural - like, for example, in the old days, allowing a woman to vote. Interestingly, no culture forbids us to photosynthesise... Now that would be unnatural, but it is also impossible.

<br>























## <a name="unification"></a>The unification of humanity
The post-agricultural revolution phase is the scene of ever larger masses and ever more complex cohesive narratives. Interestingly, these tales are full of internal contradictions. For example, since the French Revolution, the main values in much of the world have been freedom and equality, which are contradictory in themselves. Liberals chase freedom so hard that they trample on equality - just ask Dickens. And the communist pursuit of equality about shits on freedom - just ask Solzhenitsyn.

But it's okay, it's these cognitive dissonances that drive the world forward. And yes, there is such a thing as "forward", because we are undeniably moving towards unity. And the three main drivers are money, empire and religion:

traders believe that the whole world is a market and everyone is a potential buyer;
for the conquerors, the whole world is one nation and everyone is a potential subject;
and the prophets say that the whole world is one truth, and everyone is a potential believer.


Money has seamlessly connected even a group of people on either side of a conquest or religious divide, and is therefore in some ways the most powerful of the three. To develop it, we need to understand that the growing masses and the specialisation necessary for the development of each area meant that barter was no longer good enough. Not only should we know the exchange rates of everything for everything - which is already a lot - but for exchange to take place in the first place, it would not hurt if both parties wanted to exchange. Now, if you're peddling apples, you want shoes, and the shoemaker hates apples, you're fucked.

That's why they invented the concept of 'money', which is basically a universal medium of exchange, and even a store of wealth. Without it, economies of this size, complexity and dynamism could not have been created. It is based on trust - another inter-subjective imaginary system - so for a long time people had to be habituated to objects of real value, until we finally got to paper money. Yet it crosses cultural boundaries relatively easily because it doesn't necessarily ask us to believe in something. It was enough just to believe that the other person believed.



Node benefit or not, if someone was tough enough, they could still use force to upset that whole balance, so let's look at our second starter, the empire. Its most significant role is really to 'grind together' more and more ethnically and culturally diverse regions. You could say that they are melting pots, which once they absorb a people, they are unlikely to come out again. I mean, the empire will collapse sooner or later, of course, but the national identity that was annexed will have disappeared by then, only the inhabitants of the ex-empire - who usually have only a new empire waiting for them.

There is also a big difference between, say, the early conquering kings and the "emperors". Whereas the king thinks only of his own kingdom and makes no secret of this, the emperor thinks that the conquered are now his subjects and therefore he cares about them. You could say that he subjugates them 'for their own good'. Sort of like a parent's responsibility to a child - even if they are not on the same shelf. They have an important legacy of standardisation and have also had an important role in policing and maintaining infrastructure.

So just as they are obviously not purely "good guys" (taxes, forced recruitment), to label empires as clearly "bad guys" would be equally incorrect. They left behind a lot of effects that could not be "cut out" today - and the old oppressors probably wouldn't want to.

?
[...] there is no academic or political surgery that can cut out the legacies of empire without killing the patient.

The challenge of today is likely to be the emergence of a truly global empire. On the way to this goal, 'independent' nations are also becoming less independent and increasingly influenced by global opinions and trends. But that's OK, because individually we would be too few to solve truly global problems.



Religion today is best known for divisiveness and disagreement, but it is actually the third most important unifying factor after money and empires. Its purpose is to give some semblance of superhumanity to the current imaginary order, so that at least its parts are not contested, and thus to promote communal cooperation. If, in addition, it is universal and missionary - that is, what is believed applies to everyone and everyone is informed about it - then there is the new great unifying tool.

The animism mentioned in Caveman is inherently local. If there was a "sacred tree" in one group's valley, it wasn't proclaimed to other groups... Who gives a damn about their tree! He also treated man as equal to his environment. The agricultural revolution has made a nice little hierarchy out of this, because man is obviously just above his flock now. But if the animals and plants are below me, I just don't talk to them anymore... But who do I ask for a decent harvest? And God(s) be praised.

According to the polytheistic attitude, there is a "main" force, but it is impartial and doesn't give a damn what the situation is - or "fate". That's why you need other, limited sub-gods to bargain with. It is an inherently open mindset, we don't chase each other around shouting apostasy. Over time, however, some have begun to proclaim their favorites as unique. And here the tolerance was not very strong, because if your god is real but tells you otherwise, then we don't know everything and ours is not "omnipotent". And this deep-rooted contradiction we propose to resolve by saying: die!

?
[...] over the course of the next 1,500 years, Christians were slaughtered by the millions by Christians who had a nuanced understanding of the religion of love and compassion.

Of course, along with the great formal conversion, we still retained much of the polytheistic line, only now we called them 'saints' and you could pray to them for specialised help when the big boss was busy. But there was also the dualistic influence of the Devil and his connected appendages - which makes no sense with an all-powerful God, but that didn't stop us. That's what the literature calls "syncretism", which is the simultaneous acceptance of conflicting beliefs (doublethink, anyone?). And in fact, this is the real big world religion, where everyone believes what is convenient.

It's important to note, along with all this, that you don't necessarily need gods to have a religion. Communism, liberalism, nationalism, capitalism, fascism, etc., which are called "ideologies" in modern parlance, are also "religions". And if this is so, then religions have not only lost their importance in modern times, but have in fact become more totally imposed on us than ever before.



So, it is about clear that history has moved towards something like unity. But why did it become what it became? We don't know. Of course, some people claim that "so and so" makes it obvious that it had to be this way, but that's just the effect of the "hindsight is easy" syndrome. Usually, the more we delve into the history of a period, the muddier the waters become, because we see what else could just as easily have been.

The lesson is that studying history is not about predicting the future. It is, however, an opportunity to recognise that what has happened so far is neither 'natural' nor necessarily in our best interests, nor even inevitable. Armed with this knowledge, we will hopefully be able to deal with the present more wisely and with a broader perspective.

<br>



























## <a name="scientific"></a>The scientific revolution

If we had missed 500 years between 1000 and 1500, we would not have been so surprised. But if we'd done it between 1500 and 2000, we'd have been scared shitless about where we'd end up! Humanity has moved at an unprecedented pace since we realised that science is not only good for maintaining world order, but also for moving it forward.

It was not a great revolution of knowledge, but rather of ignorance. We were finally willing to admit that we do not know everything; indeed, even what we think we know may be wrong. Since then, we have relied on objective observations and have tried to combine them into theories by mathematical methods. For a long time there were only two kinds of ignorance:

Individual ignorance about something important &#8658; ask the priest, he knows - because we already know everything that is important; and
Collective ignorance about something irrelevant &#8658; nobody knows, but we don't give a shit.
In contrast, the big breakthroughs that have happened recently have come about precisely because we have admitted that we don't collectively know very important things either!

For a long time we believed that the past was the golden age; at best we can hold that level, but no higher. The Icarus story is also very much about 'getting off the high horse', if I may use that metaphor. Then, gradually, science began to solve problems that had seemed insoluble until then, and it is possible to redesign. We're getting to the point where we can compete with death itself! So far it has been central to all religions and philosophies as an inevitable part of human life. But in more modern ideologies, it is almost absent, because although we have not yet won the battle, we at least believe that it can be won.

Science itself is amoral and impotent. Without money you are a genius, and with enough money even geniuses can be replaced. But money can only be acquired with the right political, economic or religious background. So, in the final analysis, here again we have a repetition of the money/conquest/religion trio, only after the revolution of ignorance - in reverse order. And we are almost done with the first one, because instead of our 'myths' that had sustained the social order, we have increasingly come to believe in science itself, almost on a religious level.

From an empire's point of view, a lot of new technology didn't hurt either; especially if it was coupled with the right attitude. This is where Europe started to really stand out, because although the inventions were easy to copy, the attitude was not. The rest of us all thought we already knew it all, and the European 'proud ignorance' was not a little bit of a knock against us. Nor can the great spirit of discovery and conquest that was the hallmark of the era be said to be 'universal'. Elsewhere, the conquest either only reached as far as the neighbours, or the exploration was only half-hearted. In our country, on the other hand, we crossed the sea immediately, and now everything belongs to our king! And this was not 'disputed' for so long by anyone from Asia, which had enjoyed almost exclusive dominance until then, that they were left behind.

During the conquests, we also asked about things that the locals didn't give a shit about. So we deciphered dead languages, old cultures, etc. And with this great knowledge of the place, very few of us were able to overwhelm very many; all the while, of course, showing that we were just helping them to develop. But let's not forget the immense lesson of the previous chapter: here too we cannot say that what happened was good or bad, because it simply transformed everything to such an extent that it has shaped the culture of our time - including the ideologies and values by which we would judge it.

In a word, science has helped the conquests a great deal, without it we could not have conquered the world in the way we have. But in return, the conquerors also helped science a lot, because without their support, this way of thinking would not have spread and the results would not have been possible.



Let us not forget the money that was at work behind both. And what allowed the money to flow more freely was the belief in a greater future... and credit. The stagnation up to then was also a self-fulfilling prophecy: no money, therefore no bakery, therefore no growth in the economy, therefore no confidence in the future, therefore no credit to open a bakery. But the scientific revolution gave us confidence in the future, and with the same self-fulfilment, development could take off.

The other obstacle in the way was the belief that we could only be rich at the expense of others. Let's just say that the size of the cake doesn't change, so if I have more, you have less. But that was also 'happily' solved because Adam Smith came along and (very simplistically) said that if he had more profit, he could employ more workers, which would make everyone better off. In doing so, he actually magically made wealth moral - if profits are really used to increase production. This tiny stratified view, called capitalism, started out as an economic trend, but has now become so intertwined with the notions of justice, freedom and even happiness that it has almost become an overarching worldview. The only good thing about our decidedly finite reality is that we have not yet had to face the impossibility of infinite growth - because there has always been some scientific breakthrough that 'fits the bill'.

Alongside science, conquests have increasingly been financed by bankers. And because money preferred to flow to competent bankers rather than to the lavish treasuries of royalty, the world gradually moved from kings to joint-stock companies. Over time, these companies grew so powerful that they became increasingly involved in running the state. They think that the free market will work itself out for the best, so of course they want as little state intervention as possible.

What this view forgets is that the whole market and credit system is based on trust in a better future, which would not be bad if the laws were enforced - which is the job of the state. And, of course, capitalism will not just regulate itself, whatever anyone thinks. We've seen a lot of inhumanity driven by profit before, not by royalty or religion. And I'm not sure the oppressed will appreciate it much more if we stomp on them for "cold capitalist calculation" instead of "burning Christian or fascist hatred".



Let's then turn for a moment to how the modern coexistence of religion-empire-money, 'scientific global capitalism', has changed our everyday lives. We used to be able to use everything for 'what it was good for' - the wind, for example, drives boats, but it doesn't heat them.

Then we learned to convert energy: gunpowder, steam, internal combustion engines, electricity. And as our knowledge grows, we see what else we could use. Just the sun alone could supply the annual energy needs of the human race in 90 minutes, and then there's gravity, wind, the atom, etc. So energy would be fine if we didn't destroy the planet in the process.

With a tailwind like that, even 2% of the population can feed the rest and the rest can go to work on the assembly lines. And the sudden influx of labour, in line with capitalist principles, has boosted production so much that nowadays the problem is more one of finding someone to sell to. Thus the consumer society has evolved, where it is ethical to give in to desire and thrift is self-repression! It is no different with food: the US spends more on dieting than it needs to feed the world's hungry. But the battle cry is still capitalism, where eating little is 0 ration of benefit, while eating a lot and then dieting is 2 rations of benefit. Of these, 2 is the greater. Do the math... it really comes out!



Of course our social systems are not left untended. The natural rhythm has been taken over by industrial precision, and urbanisation and democratisation have increasingly broken the communal and 'tribal' threads. The family used to mean jobs, health insurance, entertainment, law and order, education, etc. It wasn't always good, of course, but it worked; the king was paid about 'protection money' in the form of taxes. If someone broke out of this family circle, they were either dead, became a servant, or could go into the military/whore trade.

Today, individuality is completely the basis, you can do what you want, even if the family doesn't like it; you are not dependent on them. Of course, the maximum individuality of young people doesn't absolve parents of responsibility, it just makes it 'a bit' harder for them.

?
Parental authority is in full retreat, but if anything goes wrong in the lives of young people, the parents will certainly be responsible. Mum and Dad have about as much chance of acquittal in a Freudian courtroom as in a Stalinist one.

But we are all the more dependent on the state (which now provides protection, health insurance, education) and the market (which provides food, jobs, etc.). In addition, the void created by the disappearing communities has had to be filled, bringing imagined communities more and more to the fore. Before there was state and religion, but now they have been replaced by nationality and buying tribes.

Today's social order is in a constant state of flux, something that in the past, apart from the revolutions, would have been unimaginable. Everyone has striven to find a better place in the system, but how can the system itself be different?! But today, even the most conservative are campaigning on how much better it will be, reform after reform. We tend to emphasise the negatives of all this change in history - uprisings, genocides, dictators - but if you look at it, by many measures, this is the most peaceful period for the human race since the 2nd world war (and by no small margin). And it's different from a simple pause between wars, because our attitudes are also increasingly leaning towards peace. The truth is that in the modern world, there is more and more profit in peaceful trade than in wars where the spoils are not so great. Just to put a positive spin on it.



OK, so what does all this mean for our collective happiness? Because the current ideologies are based on pretty much airbrushed models of happiness, and historians not only don't have the answers, they haven't even really asked the question. Because of the subjective nature of happiness, initial attempts have used questionnaires and compared the responses with various criteria. Early findings, for example, are that money matters only to a certain extent, or that the social factor (especially marriage) matters much more than having a lot of money or even poor health. But the biggest finding remains consistent with the ancient philosophy: it is expectations that are the problem. If you are content with what you have, you will be happier. Khhhmmm, Marcus Aurelius, khhmm!

On a scientific basis, human life seems to make no sense, but that doesn't mean everyone can imagine what they want. Just be aware that, for example, a scientist who sees the meaning of his life in increasing the knowledge of mankind is no less delusional than the medieval peasant for whom the afterlife gave meaning to life. But if he really believes in it, it is all the same; his delusion affects his happiness precisely because he believes in it.



To conclude, let us turn our attention a little to the future. So far, the basic assumption has been that man plays within the rules of biology, even if he has been given a bigger playing field than the others. But increasingly we are literally pushing the boundaries.

We are biologically tampering with genes, and sooner or later we will tamper with Sapiens itself until the end result is no longer Sapiens. In terms of cyborgisation, we already use glasses and hearing aids, but there will also be a sentient artificial arm and direct brain-machine interfacing. And in non-organic design, increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence could even lead to a digitally replicated brain.

All this raises a lot of questions that, for the moment, either sound absurd or are - in our current understanding - unanswerable. Soon, however, our 'descendants' may come along who will answer them; and to them we will be less than the Neanderthals were to us. In any case, for the time being, these are only fantasies, and it may well be that the future holds something quite different. When space travel started, for example, everyone was fantasising about Martian colonies (which have never happened since), but nobody expected the internet (without which we could no longer live).

In fact, we should be "proud" because we are already practically gods. But let's be aware of our little flaw: despite our growing power, we still don't know what we want. And so we had better be proud and cautious, because there are few things more dangerous than disgruntled and irresponsible gods who don't even know what they want...

## Summary

Isn't it fun to breeze through the entire history of the world in about half an hour? Especially since it's (in my opinion) more useful than 12 years' worth of school classes combined... But for a blog post, even this much is still pretty damn long, so let me just very briefly summarize the most important lesson from each section:

- The cognitive revolution has shown us that it's our "delusions" that really elevate us above the animals &#8658; so if we want a better life, we should just tell ourselves "better stories";

- The agricultural revolution has shown us that in the long run, "improvements" can turn out really shitty, even if they seemed like good ideas at the time &#8658; so let's be very careful about how we measure the quality of our lives;

- The unification of mankind has shown us that, despite our perceived differences, we are all still mostly alike &#8658; so perhaps it would be worth focusing on our similarities instead; and finally

- The scientific revolution has shown us that the fastest way to progress is to realize what we *don't* know &#8658; so... I don't know... Maybe we should read more?







































Nem titkolt kezdeti cél ugye a minél szélesebb és változatosabb "alap" megteremtése, ahonnan aztán a kismillió felmerülő szálat követve egyre jobban lefedhetünk mindent... is!
Így gondoltam a filozófia és a pszichológia mellett a történelemre is kitérhetnénk kicsit alaposabban.
Ezzel egyúttal a [Flow]()-ban korábban felmerült tanácsnak is eleget teszünk és a [48 törvényes]() történelmi példák vonalát is tovább visszük.
Na persze az sem árt, hogy konkrétan ezt a könyvet orrba-szájba ajánlják mindenhol.

Valamit viszont szögezzünk le előre: én személy szerint mindig is nyíltan és hangosan utáltam a történelmet, mint tantárgyat.
A matek / angol / informatika triumvirátuson felül "szeretni" mondjuk nem szerettem semmi mást, de a történelem a maradékból is kilógott.
Mi lenne azonban, ha felülvizsgálnánk ezt az előítéletemet?
Mi van, ha az is inkább a tanítási rendszer -- vagy az éretlen kis idióta fejem -- hibája volt, és nem a történelemé?
Elvégre nem voltam sokkal jobb véleménnyel a filozófiáról sem egészen addig, amíg [Marcus Aurelius]() alapjaiban nem változtatta meg a hozzáállásomat...

Ilyen hangulatban, nyitott elmével álltam tehát neki [Yuval Noah Harari -- Sapiens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens){:target="_blank"} című könyvének, és nagyon megérte.
Önmagában hatalmas előrelépés, hogy nem kell utána évszám-fogalom-név dolgozatot írni, de ami igazán számít, az az absztrakt, magaslati nézőpont, és a kivizsgált összefüggések.
A lefedett téma nem kevesebb, mint az egész emberi faj sorsának alakulása, amit pedig 3 nagy forradalom hatásaira vezetünk vissza:

1. [A kognitív forradalom](#a-kognitív-forradalom) -- avagy hogy lettünk állatokból ősemberek;
2. [A mezőgazdasági forradalom](#a-mezőgazdasági-forradalom) -- avagy hogy lettünk ősemberekből "modern" emberek;
    - 2,5. pontnak mondható [Az emberiség egyesülése](#az-emberiség-egyesülése) -- avagy hogy lettünk sok elszigetelt embercsoportból egy nagy "nép"; és végül
3. [A tudományos forradalom](#a-tudományos-forradalom) -- avagy hogy lettünk emberekből istenek.

Mindeközben trendeket fedezünk fel, alaposabban megismerjük magunkat, és remélhetőleg tanulunk a hibáinkból.

<br />
























## A kognitív forradalom

Kiindulási állapotában a Sapiens nem volt egy nagy szám.
Az agyunk durván nagy volt ugyan -- az állatokénak triplája, ami azóta még duplázódott -- de ez önmagában nem garantált túlélési stratégia.

> Egy csimpánz vitát ugyan nem nyerhet egy Sapiens ellen, de ettől még könnyen szét tudná tépni...
> > A chimpanzee can't win an argument with a Homo sapiens, but the ape can rip the man apart like a rag doll.

A másik különlegességünk a két lábon járás, ami a kezünk fejlődésének -- és az ebből adódó eszközhasználatnak -- jó, de a gerincünknek már kevésbé.
A nőknek meg aztán főleg csodás, hogy pont akkor megy össze a medencéjük, amikor a gyerekek feje az agy kapcsán egyre csak nő.
Nem meglepő ezért, hogy relatíve ilyen "koraszülöttek" vagyunk, és hogy ennyire hangsúlyos a szocializálódás a tehetetlen gyerekek ellátása érdekében.

De mindezek ellenére is vagy 2 millió évig csak a tápláléklánc közepén nyomorogtunk, amin még a tűz hasznosítása sem változtatott jelentősen.
70.000 éve mégis annyira lendületesen nekiálltunk "kellemetlenkedni", hogy a következő 60.000 évben az összes többi ember-szerűség kihalt.
Van, aki ezt összeolvadással vagy egyéb független tényezőkkel magyarázná, de nézzünk tükörbe:

> A tolerancia nem a Sapiens védjegye.
> > Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark.

<br />

A hirtelen megtáltosodásunk pedig nem másnak köszönhető, mint egy "kognitív robbanásnak": a Sapiens nyelvi képességei idővel messze túlszárnyalták a konkurenciát.
A nagyobb kifejezőerő miatt pontosabb információ áramlást tett lehetővé, és a csoportokat összetartó szociális "pletykálkodás" is sokat nyomott a latba.
De a legfontosabb mégis a fikció, vagyis hogy képesek voltunk olyan dolgokról beszélni -- és _hinni benne_ -- amik nem léteznek!

A közös hitek kialakulása pedig egyre nagyobb és nagyobb embertömegek együttműködését tették lehetővé.
És itt most ne is csak a vallásra gondoljunk, hanem a nemzetiségekre, a törvényekre, a pénzre, az emberi jogokra, stb.

> Senki nem hazudott, amikor 2011-ben az ENSZ azt követelte, hogy a Líbiai kormány tartsa be a polgárok emberi jogait, pedig mind az ENSZ, mind Líbia, mind pedig az "emberi jogok" csak a képzeletünk szüleményei.
> > No one was lying when, in 2011, the UN demanded that the Libyan government respect the human rights of its citizens, even though the UN, Libya and human rights are all figments of our fertile imaginations.

Jó példa, hogy a teliholdkor szeánszra összegyűlő druidákat primitív idiótáknak nevezzük, és közben nem vesszük észre, hogy a modern világ intézményei pontosan ugyanez az elv alapján működnek.
Egy sikeres üzletember pedig tulajdonképpen egy sámán, csak ő még furcsábbakat mond.
A képzelt mítoszok által vadidegenek is könnyen együtt tudtak működni, és ez egy "kulturális előzősávot" nyitott, ahol lehagyhattuk a lassú evolúciós tempóban haladókat.
A csimpánzok nem tudják lemondatni az alfa hímet, hogy innentől legyen demokrácia... de mi igen.

<br />

Az ekkori életmódról konkrét leletek hiányában elég nehéz bármit is magabiztosan állítani, de valamilyen szinten próbálkozni mégis érdemes, mert a vékony civilizációs réteg alatt még ma is ugyanez a program ketyeg a fejünkben.
Kajából a gyűjtögetők például ösztönösen bezabáltak, ha volt, mert ki tudta, meddig lesz; nem csoda, hogy a bőség korában annyit diétázunk.
Család és szexualitás terén inkább a közösségi, "mindenki mindenkivel" volt a divat; nem csoda tehát az sem, hogy a monogámia korában annyit járunk pszichológushoz.

Pár tíztől pár százig terjedő csapatokban történhetett a szorosabb együttműködés, és a gyűjtögetés miatt szükséges volt a gyakori vándorlás.
Specializálódás helyett általános tudás -- és jelentős fizikai fittség -- kellett a túléléshez.
Vallás szempontjából az _animizmus_ volt a jellemző, vagyis kb. mindennek lelke van, nincs hierarchia, és szabad a kommunikáció.
Az ennél részletesebb teóriák leginkább csak a saját nézőpontjaink belemagyarázása a _nagyon kevés_ bizonyítékba.

<br />

A korszak másik nagy áttörését az jelentette, hogy végre el tudtuk hagyni a Afro-Ázsiai kontinenst.
Először Ausztráliába, aztán -- Szibérián keresztül, akkor még gyalog -- Amerikába, majd szépen sorban kb. mindenhova eljutottunk, ugyanazzal a forgatókönyvvel.
Az evolúció nem bírt velünk lépést tartani, felborítottuk az ökoszisztémákat, és kihalásba kergettük a növény- és állatvilág felét.
Ez volt az _első_ irtás, amit a mezőgazdasági forradalom háziasításaival tulajdonképpen megismételtünk.
Ha ezt többen felérnék ésszel, akkor talán nem szarnának olyan magasról a harmadik körre, amit épp most csinálunk.

<br />






























## A mezőgazdasági forradalom

A vadászat és a gyűjtögetés kb. 10.000 évvel ezelőttig volt "divat", amikor is elkezdtünk egy-két kiválasztott növénnyel és állattal egy csomót foglalkozni.
Manapság sem látjuk át rendesen a világ ökológiai összefüggéseit -- nemhogy akkoriban -- de azért persze, nyúljunk csak bele.
Mi baj lehet?

Gyakori mese, hogy az ember -- ahogy egyre intelligensebb lett -- végre meghódította a természetet, hogy így jobb élete lehessen.
Na ebből annyi jogos, hogy összességében már több kaja állt az emberiség, mint faj, rendelkezésére.
De közben az átlag farmer többet dolgozott, és cserébe rosszabbul étkezett. Szóval akkor mi van?!

> Ezek a növények háziasították a Sapienst, és nem fordítva.
> > These plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice versa.

A negatívumait estig sorolhatnánk: megfelelő környezet kell neki, gazolás, tápanyag ellátás, öntözés, és védelem; nem lett tőle jobb a diéta, rossz volt a testalkatunknak is a vele kapcsolatos munka, nem adott nagyobb biztonságot (sőt, így csak épp jobban függtünk valamitől), és nem adott nagyobb védelmet az agresszió ellen sem (sőt, a privát tulajdon miatt csak talán még rosszabb lett a helyzet).
A pozitívum pedig annyi, hogy több emberi példány létezhet egyszerre. Pont.

Persze az egyének csak azért nem mentek volna ebbe bele, mert a fajnak "jó".
De nagy szerencsétlenségünkre az ide vezető úton minden egyes lépés önmagában akkor még jó ötletnek tűnt.

- A búza is része az étrendnek, ezért visszahordjuk a táborba feldolgozni &#8658; hopp, leesik pár, és jövőre már az ösvényen is van búza.
- Hát akkor már miért nem szórjuk úgy, hogy ott legyen, ahol akarjuk? &#8658; még több lesz, de azért még más is van bőven.
- Hát akkor miért nem töltünk itt évente valamennyi időt betakarítani? &#8658; egyre több lesz, és már annyi idő sem elég.
- Hát akkor miért nem telepedünk itt le véglegesen? &#8658; még több lesz, de más már nem igazán.
- Hát akkor miért nem teszünk belőle félre, hogy jobban menjen a vetés &#8658; még több lesz.
- Hát akkor miért nem fejlesztjük a technikánkat (mély vetés, gazolás, eszközök, stb.) &#8658; még több lesz.
- Hát akkor már miért ne lenne több gyerek, ha van elég kaja &#8658; gyorsan feléltük a felesleget, és most már még több kaja kell!
- Hát akkor viszont dolgozzunk, és építsünk falakat is, hogy el ne vegyék mások &#8658; még több meló!

Mire rájöttünk, hogy ez szar üzlet volt, addigra már:

1. nem is emlékeztünk, hogy régen hogy volt, és
2. eleve túl sokan voltunk, hogy működjön a régi módszer, még ha emlékeznénk is.

Akinek esetleg gyanús, hogy most is ugyanezt csináljuk, az nyert egy igen szar felismerést: igen, most is ugyanezt csináljuk.
Kitaláltunk például egy csomó mindent az időnyerésre, és aztán annál kevesebb időnk van...

> A történelem kevés alapszabálya közül az egyik, hogy a luxusból szükséglet lesz, ami új kötelezettségekhez vezet.
> > One of history's few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations.

<br />

Együtt járt ez egy pszichológiai forradalommal is, ahol a "mi területünk"-ből egyre inkább az "én házam" lett, a jelenből pedig a jövő felé fordulás.
A hosszútávú tervezés azonban nem nagyon jött be a parasztoknak, mert mindig kialakult valami elit réteg, akik lefölözték a felesleget, hogy ők politizálhassanak, háborúzhassanak, művészkedhessenek, vagy filozofáljanak.
Az egyre nagyobb szabású együttműködéshez pedig egyre fontosabbá váltak a közös mítoszok.
Persze ne feledjük, hogy itt "együttműködés" címszó alatt azért simán belefért a rabszolgaság is.

Példának összevetjük Hamurapi törvényoszlopát az amerikai Függetlenségi Nyilatkozattal.
Mondjuk úgy, hogy elég különböző a hozzáállásuk az emberi jogokhoz, de ennek ellenére mindkettő azt állítja, hogy univerzális, általános igazságokat tartalmaz.
A látszólagos ellentmondás feloldása kellemetlen, de egyszerű: egyik sem univerzális igazság.
Mindkettő csak egy sztori, amit bemesélünk magunknak.

De hát ugye ha azt akarjuk, hogy az emberek higgyenek egy képzeletbeli rendszerben, akkor első sorban pont csak azt ne említsük, hogy képzeletbeli!
Ha viszont tartjuk a szánkat, akkor a társadalom segít majd az újoncokba is beleverni a rendszert.
Eleve a vágyainkat és az ízlésünket is a kor domináns hitei formálják (semmi természetes nincs például a külföldön nyaralásban).
Az ilyen képzeletbeli rendszerek _inter-szubjektívak_, vagyis azért léteznek, mert sokan hisznek bennük.
Egy ilyet pedig csak úgy lehet megdönteni, ha teszünk valami mást -- valami erősebbet -- a helyére.

> A képzeletbeli rendszerekből nincs kiút. Amikor kitörünk a börtönünk falai közül és a szabadság felé futunk, igazából csak egy még tágasabb börtön udvarára futunk ki.
> > There is no way out of the imagined order. When we break down our prison walls and run towards freedom, we are in fact running into the more spacious exercise yard of a bigger prison.

<br />

Mivel szinte mindenünk képzeletbeli sztorikon alapul, ezekre nem ártana emlékezni is -- ami viszont egy idő után nem skálázható.
Az agyunk evolúciója során a növények, az állatok, a környezetünk, és a szociális viszonyok megfigyelése volt a lényeg.
A komolyabb mértékű együttműködéshez elengedhetetlen nyers adattárolás _nem_ -- ezért a nagyobb rendszerek mind be is borultak.
Így ment ez egészen 5.000 évvel ezelőttig, amikor is a sumérok felfedeztek egy agyon kívüli adattárolási rendszert: az írást.

Kellett ugyan módosítani az emberi "holisztikus", szabad asszociáció alapú gondolkodásunkon, hogy egy kicsit "gépiesebb" legyen, de a tranzakciók, adók, és ilyesmik rögzítéséhez ez volt az alkalmas.
Előkészítette továbbá a terepet az arab számoknak, amik -- egy-két műveleti jellel karöltve -- egy nagyon kifejező és logikus nyelvet adtak a kezünkbe.
Ezekből ma már leginkább csak a **0** és az **1** számít, de azok viszont fontosabbak, mint bármi más.

<br />

A hierarchikus megkötések mindig megjelennek a társadalomban, csak épp mindig máshogy -- ami jól mutatja, hogy semmi "természetes" nincs bennük, csak akkor épp azt találták ki.
Lehet, hogy ma épp nem divat rassz alapján bekorlátozni, hogy "egy fekete nem lakhat itt"... De azt meg érdekes módon nem furcsálljuk, hogy vannak környékek, ahol "csak gazdagok lakhatnak".
Akárhogy is, a nagy együttműködéseknél kellenek a szociális jelek, hogy kivel hogy kell bánni, ki hol van a ranglétrán a másikhoz képest, stb.

Arra vigyázzunk csak, hogy a "szimplán így alakult" részt jó alaposan elfedjük a közvélemény elől, nehogy a szolgák véletlen elvágják a torkunkat éjszaka.
Az amerikai rabszolgáknál is megvan például a teljesen logikus, gazdasági magyarázata, hogy miért pont Afrikából érte meg a kereskedőknek "importálni", de emellett azért mosni akarták kezeiket.
Kitaláltak ezért egy csomó baromságot, hogy a "negrók" nem olyan intelligensek vagy morálisak, tisztátalanok, betegségeket terjesztenek, vallásilag más családfáról származnak, akiknek ez a sors az átkuk, stb.
És ezek a "mesék" sajnos még a rabszolgaság eltörlése után is sokáig megmaradtak az emberek fejében.

Így alakultak ki olyan szívmelengető ördögi körök, mint mondjuk amikor azért nem kapsz megbecsült állást, mert egy lenézett társadalmi rétegbe tartozol; és azért nézik le a társadalmi rétegedet, mert onnan szinte senkinek nincs megbecsült állása...
Ez egyáltalán nem egyedi eset: a véletlenszerű történelmi események által teremtett erőviszonyok gyakran olyan igazságtalan világrendhez vezetnek, amik idővel önmagukat erősítik.
Többek közt ezért érdemes történelmet _is_ tanulni, mert a biológia nem magyarázza a hatalmas szakadékokat egyes embercsoportok között.

Jó ökölszabály az ilyenek felfedésére, hogy "a biológia lehetővé tesz, a kultúra megtilt".
A köznyelvben a "természetest" a kultúra alapján értelmezzük, ezért beszélhetünk olyan sokat arról, ami nem természetes -- mint például régebben arról, hogy egy nő is szavazhasson.
Érdekes módon azt semelyik kultúra nem tiltja meg, hogy fotoszintetizáljunk... Na _az_ tényleg természetellenes lenne, de ezért lehetetlen is.

<br />






























## Az emberiség egyesülése

A mezőgazdasági forradalom utáni szakasz az egyre nagyobb tömegek, és az egyre komplexebb összetartó mesék színtere.
Érdekes módon ezek a mesék viszont tele vannak belső ellentmondásokkal.
Például a Francia forradalom óta a világ nagy részén fő értékek a szabadság és az egyenlőség, amik már önmagukban ellentétesek.
A liberálisok annyira a szabadságot kergetik, hogy közben az egyenlőségen taposnak -- kérdezd csak Dickenst.
A kommunista egyenlőségre törekvés meg kb. szarik a szabadságra -- kérdezd csak Szolzsenyicint.

De semmi gond, pont ezek a _kognitív disszonanciák_ hajtják előre a világot.
És igen, van olyan, hogy "előre", mert tagadhatatlanul az egység felé haladunk.
Ennek a három fő mozgató rugója pedig a pénz, a birodalom, és a vallás, ugyanis:

- a kereskedők szerint az egész világ egy piac, és mindenki potenciális vevő;
- a hódítók szerint az egész világ egy nemzet, és mindenki potenciális alattvaló;
- a próféták szerint pedig az egész világon egy igazság érvényes, és mindenki potenciális hívő.

<br />

A **pénz** még egy hódítási vagy vallási szakadék két oldalán lévő embercsoportot is zökkenésmentesen összekötött, ezért bizonyos szemszögből a legerősebb a háromból.
Kialakulásához értenünk kell, hogy az egyre nagyobb tömegek, és az egyes területek fejlődéséhez elengedhetetlen specializáció miatt a cserekereskedelem már nem volt elég jó.
Nem csak a váltási rátákat kellene tudni mindenről mindenre -- ami már önmagában rengeteg -- de a cseréhez első sorban az sem ártana, ha mindkét fél akarná is a cserét.
Na most ha te almával házalsz, cipőt akarsz, és a cipész utálja az almát, akkor rábasztál.

Erre találták ki a "pénz" fogalmát, ami gyakorlatilag egy univerzális váltóeszköz, és még a vagyon tárolására is alkalmas.
Nélküle nem jöhettek volna létre ekkora, ilyen komplex, és ilyen dinamikus gazdaságok.
Alapja a bizalom -- ez is ilyen _inter-szubjektív_ képzeletbeli rendszer -- ezért sokáig valós értéket képviselő tárgyakkal kellett szoktatni az embereket, míg végül el nem jutottunk a papírfecnikig.
Mégis relatíve könnyen nyúl át a kulturális határokon, mert nem feltétlen tőlünk kéri, hogy higgyünk valamiben.
Elég volt csak azt elhinni, hogy a másik hisz benne.

<br />

Node haszon ide vagy oda, ha valaki elég kemény volt, akkor azért erővel is felrúghatta ezt az egész egyensúlyt, szóval nézzük második indulónkat, a **birodalmat**.
A legjelentősebb szerepe igazából annyi, hogy egyre több és több etnikailag és kulturálisan különböző régiót "csiszoljon össze".
Mondhatjuk rájuk, hogy olvasztótégelyek, amik ha egyszer bekebeleznek egy népet, az onnan valószínűleg már nem kerül ki többet.
Mármint a birodalom persze előbb vagy utóbb összeomlik, de a bekebelezett nemzeti identitás addigra már nem létezik, csak az ex-birodalom lakói -- akikre általában csak egy új birodalom várt.

Nagy különbség van mondjuk a korai hódító királyok és a "császárok" között is.
Míg a király csak a saját királyságára gondol, és ezt nem is rejti véka alá, addig a császár szerint a leigázottak most már az alattvalói, ezért törődik is velük.
Mondhatjuk, hogy "a saját érdekükben" igázza le őket.
Kb. mint a szülő felelőssége a gyerek felé -- még ha nincsenek is ugyanazon a polcon.
Fontos hagyatékuk a sztenderdizáció, és fontos szerepük volt a rendfenntartásban és az infrastruktúra karbantartásában is.

Szóval mint ahogy nyilván nem tisztán "jófiúk" (adók, kényszer toborzás), a birodalmakat egyértelműen "rosszfiúnak" címkézni is ugyanolyan helytelen lenne.
Rengeteg olyan hatást hagytak maguk után, amiket ma már nem lehetne "kivágni" -- és a régi elnyomottak ezt valószínűleg nem is akarnák.

> [...] nincs olyan akadémiai vagy politikai műtét, ami anélkül tudná kivágni a birodalmi hagyatékokat, hogy a páciens bele ne haljon.
> > [...] no academic or political surgery can cut out the imperial legacies without killing the patient.

Napjaink kihívása nagy valószínűséggel az igazi globális birodalom kialakulása lesz.
Az ide vezető úton az "önálló" nemzetek is egyre kevésbé önállóak, és egyre nagyobb hatással vannak rájuk a globális vélemények és irányzatok.
De ez nem is baj, mert az igazán globális problémák megoldásához külön-külön úgyis kevesek lennénk.

<br />

A **vallás** napjainkban leginkább a széthúzásról és az egyet nem értésről híres, de igazából a pénz és a birodalmak után a harmadik legfontosabb egyesítő tényező.
A lényege, hogy valami emberfeletti látszatot adjon az aktuális képzeletbeli rendnek, hogy legalább részei ne legyenek vitathatóak, és így elősegítse a közösségi együttműködést.
Ha ezen felül még univerzális és misszionárius is -- vagyis amit hisznek, az mindenkire vonatkozik, és erről mindenkit informálnak is -- akkor ott az új nagy egyesítési eszköz.

Az ősembernél említett animista hozzáállás eredendően lokális.
Ha egy csapat völgyében volt egy "szent fa", azt nem hirdették más csoportoknak is... Ki a rákot érdekel az ő fájuk?!
Emellett egyenrangúként kezelte az embert a környezetével.
Ebből a mezőgazdasági forradalom csinált egy szép kis hierarchiát, mert az ember nyilván csak feljebb van már, mint a nyája.
De hát ha az állatok és a növények már alattam vannak, akkor csak nem beszélgetek velük többet...
Viszont akkor kit kérjek, hogy legyen rendesen termés?
S lőn Isten(ek).

A politeista hozzáállás szerint van ugyan egy "fő" erő, de az pártatlan, és leszarja, mi a helyzet -- kb. "a sors".
Ezért kellenek egyéb, korlátozott al-istenek, akikkel lehet alkudozni.
Ez egy eredendően nyitott hozzáállás, nem hajkurásszuk egymást hitszegés felkiáltással.
Idővel azonban egyesek elkezdték a kedvenceiket egyedülállónak kikiáltani.
És itt már nem volt túl erős a tolerancia, mert ugye ha a Ti istenetek is igazi, de nektek mást mond, akkor mi nem tudunk mindent, és a miénk nem "mindenható".
Ezt a mélyen gyökerező ellentétet pedig javasoljuk úgy feloldani, hogy dögöljetek meg!

> [...] a következő 1.500 év lefolyása alatt keresztények mészároltak keresztényeket millió számra, csak mert azok egy árnyalatnyi különbséggel értelmezték a szeretet és az együttérzés vallását.
> > [...] over the course of the next 1,500 years, Christians slaughtered Christians by the millions to defend slightly different interpretations of the religion of love and compassion.

A nagy hivatalos áttérés mellett azért persze sokat megtartottunk a politeista vonalról is, csak most már "szenteknek" hívtuk őket, és hozzájuk lehetett imádkozni specializált segítségért, ha a nagyfőnök épp nem ért rá.
De volt itt még _dualista_ behatás is az Ördöggel és kapcsolt tartozékaival -- aminek egy mindenható Isten mellett semmi értelme ugyan, de ez minket nem állított meg.
Ezt nevezi a szakirodalom "_szinkretizmusnak_", ami az egymásnak ellentmondó hitek egyidejű elfogadása ([duplagondol](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplagondol){:target="_blank"}, valaki?).
És tulajdonképpen **ez** az igazi nagy világvallás, ahol mindenki azt hiszi, ami épp kényelmes.

Fontos ezek mellett észrevennünk azt is, hogy nem feltétlen kellenek istenek a valláshoz.
A modern szóhasználattal "ideológiának" nevezett kommunizmus, liberalizmus, nacionalizmus, kapitalizmus, fasizmus, stb. ugyanúgy "vallások".
És ha ez így van, akkor a vallások a modern korral nem hogy veszítenének a fontosságukból, hanem épp hogy még sokkal totálisabban ránk telepedtek, mint valaha.

<br />

Szóval, az kb. világos, hogy valami ilyesmi egység felé haladt a történelem.
De hogy miért pont ez lett, ami lett? Na ezt nem tudjuk.
Persze van, aki állítja, hogy _"ez és ez"_ miatt egyértelmű, hogy ennek kellett lennie, de ez csak az "utólag már könnyen vagyunk okosak" szindróma hatása.
Általában minél jobban elmélyedünk egy időszak történelmében, annál zavarosabb lesz a víz, mert meglátjuk, hogy mi minden más is ugyanolyan könnyen lehetett volna.

A tanulság, hogy a történelem tanulmányozása _nem_ a jövő megjósolására való.
Alkalmas viszont arra, hogy felismerjük: az eddig történtek se nem "természetesek", se nem szolgálják feltétlenül a mi érdekeinket, és még csak nem is lettek volna elkerülhetetlenek.
Ezzel felvértezve pedig remélhetőleg bölcsebben, szélesebb látókörrel kezeljük majd a jelenünket.

<br />
































## A tudományos forradalom

Ha 1000 és 1500 között hagytunk volna ki 500 évet, nem értek volna olyan nagy meglepetések.
De ha 1500 és 2000 között, akkor kb. be is szartunk volna, hova kerülünk a végén!
Az emberiség példa nélküli gyorsasággal halad, amióta rájöttünk: a tudomány nem csak arra jó, hogy fenntartsa a világrendet, hanem arra is, hogy előrevigye.

Nem a tudás nagy forradalma volt ez, hanem inkább a tudatlanságé.
Végre hajlandóak voltunk bevallani, hogy nem tudunk mindent; sőt, még az is lehet téves amit tudni vélünk.
Azóta az objektív megfigyelésekre hagyatkozunk, és matematikai módszerekkel próbáljuk összekötni őket elméletekké.
Sokáig csak kétféle tudatlanság létezett:

- Egyéni tudatlanság valami fontossal kapcsolatban &#8658; kérdezd meg a papot, ő tudja -- mert ugye már mindent tudunk, ami fontos; és
- Kollektív tudatlanság valami lényegtelennel kapcsolatban &#8658; senki nem tudja, de szarunk is rá.

Ezekkel szemben a mostanában történt nagy áttörések pontosan azért jöhettek létre, mert bevallottuk, hogy kollektíven _sem_ tudunk nagyon fontos dolgokat!
    
Sokáig hittük, hogy a múlt volt az aranykor; maximum azt a szintet tarthatjuk, de feljebb nincs.
Az Ikaruszos sztori is nagy vonalakban arról szól, hogy "szálljunk le a magas lóról", ha szabad ezzel a képzavarral élnem.
Aztán a tudomány szépen fokozatosan elkezdte megoldani az eddig megoldhatatlannak tűnő problémákat, és lehet újratervezni.
Lassan már ott tartunk, hogy magával a halállal is felvehetjük a versenyt!
Eddig minden vallásban és filozófiában központi szerepe volt, mint az emberi élet elkerülhetetlen részének.
A modernebb ideológiákban viszont már szinte nyoma sincs, mert habár még nem nyertük meg a harcot, azt már legalább elhisszük, hogy megnyerhető.

A tudomány önmagában amorális és impotens.
Pénz nélkül hiába vagy zseni, elég pénzzel pedig még a zsenik is kiválthatóak.
Pénzből viszont csak a megfelelő politikai, gazdasági, vagy vallási háttérrel lehet eleget szerezni.
Úgyhogy végső soron itt is a pénz / hódítás / vallás trió átismétlése következik, csak a tudatlanság forradalma után -- fordított sorrendben.
És az elsővel már majdhogynem végeztünk is, mert a társadalmi rendet eddig fenntartó "mítoszaink" helyett egyre inkább magában a tudományban kezdtünk hinni, szinte vallásos szinten.

<br />

A birodalmak szempontjából sem ártott a sok új technológia; főleg ha a megfelelő hozzáállással párosult.
Itt kezdett Európa nagyon elszakadni a mezőnytől, mert habár a találmányokat könnyű volt lemásolni, a hozzáállást nem.
A többiek mind úgy voltak vele, hogy ők már mindent tudnak, az Európai "büszke tudatlanság" pedig nem kicsit dobott rajtunk.
Egyáltalán nem mondható "általánosnak" a korszak védjegyévé vált nagy felfedező és hódító kedv sem.
Máshol vagy csak a szomszédokig ért a _hódítás_, vagy csak félgőzzel ment a felfedezgetés.
Nálunk bezzeg azonnal át a tengeren, és ott most már minden a mi királyunké!
Ezt pedig olyan sokáig nem "vitatta" senki az addig szinte egyeduralmat élvező Ázsiából, hogy szépen le is maradtak.

A hódítások alatt olyan dolgok felől is érdeklődtünk, amiket a helyiek le se szartak.
Így fejtettünk meg holt nyelveket, régi kultúrákat, stb.
Ezzel a nagy helyismerettel pedig nagyon kevesen is jól el tudtunk nyomni nagyon sokakat; mindeközben persze azt mutatva, hogy csak segítünk nekik fejlődni.
De ne feledjük az előző fejezet birodalmas tanulságát: itt sem mondhatjuk, hogy a történtek jók vagy rosszak voltak, mert egyszerűen olyan szinten átformáltak mindent, hogy napjaink kultúrája is nekik köszönhető -- beleértve azokat az ideológiákat és értékrendeket is, amikkel megítélnénk őket.
    
Egy szó mint száz, a tudomány rengeteget segített a hódításoknak, hiszen nélküle nem tudtuk volna így leigázni a világot.
De cserébe a hódítók is sokat segítettek a tudománynak, mert a támogatásuk nélkül nem terjedt volna el ez a gondolkodásmód, és nem lett volna lehetőség az eredményekre.

<br />

Ne feledkezzünk azért meg a pénzről sem, ami mindkettő hátterében ott munkálkodott.
És ami a pénz szabadabb áramlását lehetővé tette, az a nagyobb jövőbe vetett hit... és a hitel.
Az addigi stagnálás is egy önbeteljesítő jóslat volt: nincs pénz, ezért nincs pékség, ezért nem nő a gazdaság, ezért nincs bizalom a jövőben, ezért nincs hitel sem, hogy pékséget nyithass.
A tudományos forradalom viszont meghozta a bizalmunkat a jövő iránt, és ugyanilyen önbeteljesítéssel a fejlődés is neki tudott indulni.

A másik akadály az volt az útban, hogy azt hittük, csak a másik kárára lehetünk gazdagok.
Mondjuk úgy, hogy a torta mérete nem változik, szóval ha nekem több van, akkor neked kevesebb marad.
De ez is "szerencsésen" megoldódott, mert jött Adam Smith és (nagyon leegyszerűsítve) azt mondta, hogy ha neki több a profitja, akkor több munkást alkalmazhat, ami miatt mindenkinek jobb lesz.
Ezzel igazából varázsütésre morálissá tette a gazdagságot -- ha a profitot tényleg arra használják, hogy növeljék a termelést.
Ez az apró, _kapitalizmus_ nevezetű rétegnézet egy gazdasági irányzatként indult, de mára már annyira összefonódott az igazság, a szabadság, sőt, akár a boldogság fogalmával, hogy szinte már egy átfogó világnézetté vált.
A határozottan véges valóságunk egyetlen szerencséje, hogy eddig még nem kellett szembenéznünk a végtelen növekedés lehetetlenségével -- mert mindig volt valami tudományos áttörés, ami "állta a számlát".

A tudomány mellett a hódításokat is egyre inkább a bankárok finanszírozták.
És mivel a hozzáértő bankárokhoz szívesebben folyt a pénz, mint a pazarló uralkodói kincstárakba, a világ szép fokozatosan átállt a királyokról a részvénytársaságokra.
Ezek a társaságok pedig idővel annyira elhatalmasodtak, hogy már az állam irányításába is egyre jobban belelógott a kezük.
Szerintük a szabad piac úgyis magától megy a legjobb irányba, ezért naná, hogy minél kevesebb állami beavatkozást szeretnének.

Ez a nézet épp csak azt felejti el, hogy az egész piac és hitel rendszer alapja a bizalom a jobb jövőben, amihez azért nem ártana a törvények betartatása -- ami viszont az állam feladata.
És persze a kapitalizmus sem fogja csak úgy magát megregulázni, akárki akármit is gondol.
Korábban is láttunk már egy csomó olyan embertelenséget, amit a profit vezérelt, nem a királyi vagy vallási rend.
És nem biztos, hogy az elnyomottak sokkal jobban fogják értékelni, ha az "égő keresztény vagy fasiszta gyűlölet" helyett a "hideg kapitalista számítás" miatt taposunk rajtuk.

<br />

Térjünk ki akkor egy kicsit arra is, hogyan változtatott a hétköznapjainkon a vallás-birodalom-pénz modern együttállása, a "tudományos globál-kapitalizmus"<sup><small>TM</small></sup>.
Energia szempontjából például folyamatosan adja a kezünkbe az újabbnál újabb módszereket.
Régen csak arra használhattunk mindent, "amire való" -- a szél például hajtja ugyan a hajókat, de fűteni nem fűt.

Aztán szépen megtanultuk az energia konverziót: lőpor, gőzhajtás, belső égésű motor, elektromosság.
És ahogy a tudásunk nő, úgy látjuk meg, mi mindent használhatnánk még.
Csak a Nap 90 perc alatt ki tudná elégíteni az emberi faj éves energia igényét, és akkor még ott van mellette a gravitációs, a szél, az atom, stb.
Szóval az energiával nem lenne baj, ha nem tennénk tönkre a bolygót menet közben.

Ilyen hátszéllel már akár a lakosság 2%-a is megeteti a többieket, a többiek meg mehettek a futószalagok mellé dolgozni.
A hirtelen munkaerő beáramlás pedig a kapitalista elveknek megfelelően úgy megdobta a termelést, hogy manapság inkább az a probléma, hogy legyen kinek eladni.
Így alakult ki a fogyasztói társadalom, ahol etikus engedni a vágyaknak, a takarékosság pedig ön-elnyomás!
Nincs ez másként az evéssel sem: az USA többet költ diétázásra, mint amennyi a világ éhezőinek etetéséhez kellene.
De hát a csatakiáltás továbbra is a _kapitalizmus_, ahol keveset enni **0** adag haszon, míg sokat enni és utána lediétázni az **2** adag haszon. Ezek közül pedig a **2** a nagyobb. Számolj utána... tényleg kijön!

<br />

Nem maradtak persze _felrúgatlanul_ a szociális rendszereink sem.
A természetes ritmust átvette az ipari precizitás, a városiasodás és demokratizálódás pedig egyre jobban szétzúzta a közösségi és "törzsi" szálakat.
A család jelentette régen az állást, a betegbiztosítást, a szórakozást, a rendfenntartást, az oktatást, stb.
Ez persze nem volt mindig jó, de működött; a királynak kb. csak "védelmi pénzt" fizettek adó formájában.
Ha ebből a családi körből valaki kitört, az vagy halott volt, vagy szolga lett, vagy mehetett katonának / kurvának.

Ma már teljesen az egyéniség az alap, csinálhatsz, amit akarsz, még ha a családnak nem is tetszik; nem függsz tőlük.
A fiatalok maximális egyénisége persze nem menti fel a szülőket a felelősség alól, csak egy "kicsit" megnehezíti a dolgukat.

> A szülői tekintély teljes visszavonulóban, de azért ha bármi félresiklik a fiatalok életében, azért biztos a szülők lesznek a felelősek. Apunak és anyunak kb. annyi az esélye a felmentésre a Freudi tárgyalóteremben, mint egy Sztálini műperben.
> > Youngsters are increasingly excused from obeying their elders, whereas parents are blamed for anything that goes wrong in the life of their child. Mum and Dad are about as likely to get off in the Freudian courtroom as were defendants in a Stalinist show trial.

Annál jobban függünk viszont az államtól (aki újabban a védelmet, betegbiztosítást, oktatást adja) és a piactól (aki meg az élelmet, munkát, stb.).
Ezen felül az eltűnt közösségek által teremtett űrt is be kellett valamivel tölteni, ami egyre jobban előtérbe hozta a képzelt közösségeket.
Eddig állam volt és vallás, de most már van helyettük nacionalitás és vásárlói törzsek.

Napjaink szociális rendje folyamatos változásban van, amit régen -- a forradalmakat leszámítva -- el sem tudtak volna képzelni.
Mindenki törekedett ugyan, hogy jobb helye legyen a rendszerben, de hogy maga a rendszer is lehet más?! Na neeem...
Ma viszont még a legkonzervatívabbak is azzal kampányolnak, hogy mennyivel jobb lesz _majd_, ilyen reform, olyan reform.
Hajlamosak vagyunk ennek a sok változásnak a negatívumait hangsúlyozni a történelemben -- felkelések, népirtások, diktátorok -- de ha jobban megnézzük, a 2. világháború óta nagyon sok mérőszám szerint ez az emberi faj legbékésebb időszaka (nem is kicsivel).
És más ez a béke egyszerű háborúk közti szünetnél, mert a hozzáállásunk is egyre jobban a béke felé hajlik.
Az igazság az, hogy a modern világban egyre nagyobb a haszon a békés kereskedésben, mint az olyan háborúkban, ahol már nem lehet olyan nagyokat zsákmányolni.
Csak hogy végre valami pozitív kicsengésűt is mondjak.

<br />

Na jó, és akkor mindez mit jelent a kollektív boldogságunkra nézve?
Mert a jelenlegi ideológiák eléggé légből kapott boldogság modellekre alapoznak, a történészeknek meg nemhogy válaszuk nincs, de a kérdést se nagyon tették még fel.
A boldogság szubjektív jellegénél fogva a kezdeti próbálkozások kérdőíveket használnak, és az így kapott válaszokat vetik össze különböző szempontokkal.
Korai eredmények például, hogy a pénz csak egy szintig számít, illetve hogy a szociális faktor (főleg a házasság) sokkal többet jelent, mint a sok pénz vagy akár a rossz egészség.
A legnagyobb eredmény azonban továbbra is egybecseng az ókori filozófiával: az elvárásokkal van a baj.
Ha megelégszel azzal, amid van, akkor boldogabb leszel.
Khhhmmm, [Marcus Aurelius](), khhmm!

Tudományos alapon az emberi életnek látszólag semmi értelme, de ettől még mindenki azt képzelhet, amit akar.
Csak legyünk vele tisztában, hogy pl. egy kutató, aki az emberiség tudásának növelésében látja az élete értelmét, semmivel nem kevésbé téveszmés, mint a középkori paraszt, akinél a túlvilág adott értelmet az életnek.
De ha tényleg hisz benne, akkor mindegy is; a téveszméje pont attól hat a boldogságára, hogy hisz benne.

<br />

Befejezésként fordítsuk a figyelmünket egy kicsit a jövő felé.
Eddig az volt az alapfelvetés, hogy az ember is a biológia szabályrendszerén belül játszik, még ha nagyobb játszóteret is kapott, mint a többiek.
De egyre inkább ott tartunk, hogy már szó szerint minden határon túlmegyünk.

Biológiailag géneket piszkálunk, és előbb vagy utóbb magával a Sapiens-szel is addig fogunk molyolni, amíg már _nem_ Sapiens lesz a végeredmény.
A cyborg-osodás szempontjából már most is használunk szemüvegeket és hallókészülékeket, de lesz itt még érző műkar és közvetlen agy-gép összeköttetés is.
A nem organikus tervezésben pedig az egyre kifinomultabb mesterséges intelligencia akár egy digitálisan replikált agyig is elvezethet.

Mindez rengeteg olyan kérdést vet fel, amik egyenlőre vagy abszurdnak hangzanak, vagy konkrétan -- a mi jelenlegi felfogásunkkal -- megválaszolhatatlanok.
Hamarosan jöhetnek azonban olyan "leszármazottaink", akik majd megválaszolják; és nekik mi kevesebbek leszünk, mint nekünk a Neander-völgyi volt.
Minden esetre egyelőre nyugi, ezek csak fantáziák, és könnyen lehet az is, hogy a jövő teljesen mást tartogat.
Az űrutazás kezdetével például mindenki Marsi kolóniákról fantáziált (amiből azóta se lett semmi), de az internetre meg nem számított senki (ami nélkül meg már élni sem tudnánk).

Igazából "büszkék" lehetünk, mert már most is gyakorlatilag istenek vagyunk.
Legyünk viszont tisztában azzal a kis szépséghibánkkal, hogy az egyre növekvő hatalmunk ellenére továbbra sincs fingunk sem, hogy mit akarunk.
És ezért jobb, ha büszke mellett óvatosak is leszünk, mert kevés veszélyesebb dolog van az olyan elégedetlen és felelőtlen isteneknél, akik még azt sem tudják, hogy mit akarnak...

## Összefoglalás

Hát nem poén fél óra alatt végigszambázni az egész világtörténelmen?
Főleg úgy, hogy (szerintem) hasznosabb, mint a 12 osztály tananyaga együtt...
De blog bejegyzésnek viszont még így is rohadt hosszú, úgyhogy csak nagyon röviden foglaljuk össze a legfontosabb tanulságokat:

- A kognitív forradalom megmutatta, hogy a "képzelgéseink" emelnek minket igazán az állatok fölé &#8658; ezért ha jobb életet akarunk, csak meséljünk magunknak "jobb sztorikat";
- A mezőgazdasági forradalom megmutatta, hogy hosszú távon az a "javítás" is lehet nagyon szar, ami rövid távon jó ötletnek tűnik &#8658; ezért nagyon gondoljuk meg, hogy mi alapján mérjük az életünk minőségét;
- Az emberiség egyesülése megmutatta, hogy a vélt különbségeink ellenére milyen egyformák is vagyunk &#8658; ezért talán a hasonlóságainkra lenne érdemesebb figyelni; és végül
- A tudományos forradalom megmutatta, hogy akkor lehet a leggyorsabban fejlődni, ha belátod, hogy mi mindent _nem_ tudsz &#8658; ezért... nem is tudom... mondjuk **olvass többet**!
