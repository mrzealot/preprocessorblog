We still stick to [Thoreau]({% post_url 2023-01-06-henry-david-thoreau-walden %})'s minimalist line, but I wanted to add something modern to it, to see the principles in practice in the 21st century. For this purpose, a fairly obvious and highly recommended candidate is Cal Newport's book [Digital Minimalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism){:target="_blank"}. I didn't have to worry too much about relevance, since the subtitle of one of the chapters refers to just that: 'An old piece of advice, a new perspective'.

The author is also a university professor of computer science, who has written several times before on the intersection of technology and culture. And after his advice on working with deep concentration, more and more people started to ask him "What about my personal life?"

Because these days there are so many gadgets and apps competing for our attention - whether intentionally or unintentionally - and that's not sustainable in the long term. Some apps are often ironically bad for (also) the very things we installed them for. For example, the main benefit of Facebook is that you can stay in touch with other people; but then you get so addicted to it that you can't even have a normal conversation with your friend across the table without tapping your phone! Apps take away our autonomy, affect our moods, and although they have positive aspects, they undeniably mix good with bad.

It is these kinds of problems that we are trying to solve. But unfortunately, as with all major lifestyle changes, half-measures-meaningful strategies will not work here. What we need is a comprehensive "digital philosophy" to manage our lives. After Thoreau's cubicle lifestyle, the minimalist approach that is being promoted will hopefully not seem so extreme in the first place. And then, the more we try to look at it from a different perspective, the more we will realise that it is the amount of screen time that is acceptable today that is really extreme.

The book is in two major parts, the first of which presents the basic philosophy, with motivation and argumentation. The second part gives concrete techniques on how to keep the good aspects while giving up the bad. The exact table of contents goes like this:

1. Foundations
    - [What's the problem?](#problem) -- A lopsided arms race
    - [What's the solution?](#solution) -- Digital minimalism
    - [How do we implement it?](#implementation) -- The digital declutter
2. Practices
    - [Spend time alone!](#alone)
    - [Don't click "like"!](#like)
    - [Reclaim leisure!](#leisure)
    - [Join the attention resistance!](#resistance)

I would also like to highlight a quote from the beginning:

> Long before Henry David Thoreau exclaimed "simplicity, simplicity, simplicity," Marcus Aurelius asked: "You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life?"

In light of my reading list so far, this seems to indicate that we're on the right track... So let's get started!

<br>






## <a name="problem"></a>A lopsided arms race

Neither Facebook nor the iPhone started out with the same purpose as they ended up changing our lives. They were both attempts to optimise the 'edges' of our everyday lives in small ways - a digital university yearbook, or a phone and iPod in one, so you don't have two things in your pocket. Yet today we still wake up to find them at the centre of our lives. And that's not particularly good for us. It's like we've stepped into shit - we didn't know it, we didn't see it, but now we're in it.

The pro-technologists argue in vain that "But how useful!" That's not what we are arguing! But if we are no longer in control, it is useless.

?
It is not utility that is the main issue, but autonomy.

And if we start to wonder how we got here, the truth quickly emerges. We have probably not so much 'stepped backwards' into the shit we are talking about as been 'pushed' backwards. There is big money in it, and many have a vested interest in making your whole life revolve around gadgets and apps. Finally, an ex-Google engineer sounded the alarm, and revealed that it's not just paranoia: companies are really doing this knowingly.

Another early adopter of the problem began to dig in his heels based on his psychological background. And unfortunately, the deeper he got, the clearer the parallels with addiction became. Okay, app addiction isn't a drug, and you're probably not going to steal your own mother's jewellery for your next fix... But when it's in your pocket just a click away, it's hard to stop.

There are two main techniques in the developers' toolbox to get you hooked:

Intermittent, unpredictable positive feedback. Unpredictable, unpredictable, unpredictable feedback. And it spurs you to action even if it's not coming, because the next one will... As a mental image, feel free to imagine a slot machine! Interestingly, these little positive feedbacks are not what most people find useful, so they could be taken away.

Emphasis on social compliance. We've already seen in Sapiens the emphasis on social interactions and how deeply ingrained this is. And that's exactly what companies are exploiting! Positive feedback feels like acceptance by the tribe, and lack of it feels like not; so it's really important to pay attention to what's happening.

So we can see that we are under conscious attack and we are not just wasting so much time by accident if we are not careful. And if the "enemy" has an increasingly sophisticated war plan against us, we should also arm ourselves a little. So now that we know what we're up against, let's see how to fight back!

<br>












## <a name="solution"></a>Digital minimalism

Superficial "tips and tricks" are not enough against such methods, which can also work on our psychological weaknesses. For example, it is not enough to turn off 112 app notifications; we should ask ourselves: why on earth do we have a 112 app on our phone? The book offers digital minimalism as a more comprehensive solution:

?
Digital Minimalism: a philosophy of technology use where you spend your time online on a limited, selected, and optimized set of activities that strongly support your value proposition; everything else you happily opt out of.

As with "traditional" minimalism, there is a virtually constant value-for-money trade-off to consider. Not just looking at the positives of something, but also what it costs; or what it is instead of. Here's a bunch of examples that can be succinctly summarised: if you start from your internal value proposition, you'll often end up giving up your addiction - or at least transforming it to serve you, rather than the other way around! Newport has 3 principles to support why his philosophy works.

Clutter is expensive. I wouldn't write too verbose a "proof" here, since the author himself mentions Thoreau of all people. So go back and read the Walden post, in case anyone hasn't already! Just very succinctly, Thoreau is very much in favour of economic thinking and calculation, it's just that many of us don't calculate well. Extra things provide extra benefits, yes, but they also have a cost. And in terms of value for money they may not even be worth it anymore!


Optimisation is important. Here the book brings up the "diminishing returns" curve (but I'm not an economist; let me know if you have a nicer name). This is most often used to illustrate that after a while the extra work invested doesn't yield as much - that is, the performance growth "flattens out" and it's no longer worth the extra effort. Now we are looking at the other side of the coin, i.e. that usually a very small investment of energy at the beginning of a process can bring a big improvement in results. Let's try to take the same approach to regulating our digital consumption. Of course, the other side wants to hold this back, because as soon as we think of something as 'optimising', they won't be able to keep us there for so long. But that should be our motivation: we learn to use the positives more efficiently, and therefore we will have less time to regret it!

Intentionality is satisfying. As an example, the Amish come up, who, although at first glance they may appear to be wacky technology-deniers, on closer inspection this is no longer the case. They have their values and judge whether to allow a certain technology into their lives. It's fine to disagree with their values, but we can also learn from how conscious they are about their access to technology and how satisfied they say they are with it. The selectivity itself gives them more than what they are missing out on.

<br>
















## <a name="implementation"></a> The digital declutter

The digital minimalism outlined above is best achieved through a 3-step transformation. But be prepared for a relatively radical approach. The method is not based on gradual cessation, as attention-grabbing psychological tricks and convenience will gradually wear away our resolve. In the end, we end up back where we started. And I personally agree deeply with that. If we do something, let's do it properly!

For testing, 1,600 followers of Newport signed up, from which we received real case studies. His two main findings are that the method 1) works, but 2) it's tricky. If you are too lax - or even too tight - in your withdrawal, if you don't have substitute methods devised, or if you only think of it as a temporary "detox", it won't work. That's why he's included tips alongside the specific steps we've taken to maximise our chances of success:

Set aside a month when you will give up all optional technologies. Bye-bye to anything consumable on a screen! Including, of course, video games and TV. The word "optional" is important, of course. What you can't cut out completely (say, because of work), you should cut back on - only twice a week, only on the bus, etc.

During your month, you'll nicely discover (or even rediscover) activities that you find meaningful and enjoyable. The first 1-2 weeks can be uncomfortable, but once the detox wears off, it brings clarity. And that clarity leads to better later choices than trying to reform your habits right away without such a "fast". But you don't just have to be bored, you have to actively seek what you can use to fill the void left behind! Only obviously in a way that already fits your values.

One by one, month after month, you bring back needed technologies where the value for money tends to favour the good. But even for those, you define exactly what function they will perform and how you will use them! The 'throwback phase' is the most important factor in how much this detox will change your life in the long run. It's worth taking the next steps to screen all candidates:

Does it serve a value that is very important to me? Because it's not enough to just provide something of value.

If so, does it best serve that particular value? If not, let's leave it - only the best will do!

Even if we get that far with something, we still need a set of rules for its use. Remember, optimization!

At this point we are supposed to be "done"! Our use of digital media is optimised, and we will be able to fit a lot of things into our lives that would have seemed impossible before. And although tips and tricks alone are not enough, knowing the basics, we can now safely make things easier with extra tips and tricks... These are what we're going to do now.

<br>















## <a name="alone"></a>Spend time alone!

Let's start with what we mean by loneliness in this case. The most important thing is that you don't have to be physically alone! For many people, it would be difficult to be so far away as often as we should be. But fortunately, there is no need; it can be done in a crowd.

The important thing is to be alone in your head. But it follows that you may not be lonely during physical solitude! If you are reading a book, watching a film or listening to something, you are in touch with another mind. You need times when it is just you!

?
The problems of all mankind stem from the fact that no one can sit alone in a room in silence.

- Blaise Pascal

Everyone needs solitude to "digest" difficult problems, to gain insights from reflection, emotional balance, moral courage, and stronger relationships. Here, too, of course, balance must be sought. If we were always alone, there would be no input to process. But if you only have input all the time, you can't process it properly! Even Thoreau wasn't completely solitary, was he - he just alternated connection with privacy appropriately. We have to strive for that somehow!

Solitude deprivation is not a new phenomenon, but the extent of it is. Some people have in the past frowned on the fact that a telegram, for example, interrupted the flow of their lives. But then, loneliness was the norm, and a telegram was just a distraction. In the age of smartphones, that's all reversed, and we can enjoy a quiet moment or two.

If we deprive ourselves of solitude completely, our quality of life will deteriorate. This is what the iGeneration has unintentionally done, and all the signs are that they are paying the price - anxiety, depression, record high suicide rates, etc. The constant use of the social circuit means there is no time to 'look in the mirror' to figure out who they are, what they want, or to process their emotions and what is happening to them.

Let us therefore try to consciously build periods of solitude into our days! Concrete implementation tips:

Leave the phone at home! Leave your mobile phone at home. If you think back just a few years, everything was fine without them. No one is asking us to abandon them completely, but life shouldn't stop if we don't have them!

Let's take a long walk! Nietzsche, Rimbaud, Rousseau, Thoreau... they all praised him! Such company is worth being in! It's easy to find inspiration in books (or in the thoughts of others), but it's in solitude that we can most surely find our own voice. Obviously, you have to make time for this too, because it won't just fit in anywhere by itself. But according to Newport, we'll feel measurably happier and more productive during periods when we're walking regularly - and by more than a little!

Let's write letters to ourselves! It's actually a diary, but it's not. It's not about timing, it's about when we encounter problems, emotions, inspirations, and how writing itself can help us process them.

<br>













## <a name="like"></a>Don't click "like"!

Man is a social being... But why? Cognitive scientists have used imaging to study what is activated in the brain when we do certain activities, and what is activated when we do nothing. It turns out that the default network is for social stuff. And that's just great! We don't spend our free time thinking about social things because we're interested in other people's stuff anyway, but the other way round. We care about other people because our brains are wired by default to think about other people in our free time!

Digging further into this thread, they also saw how the rich set of information available in our brains during communication is processed through complex neural networks. And that's where trying to maintain connections through short text messages and 'likes' comes in. It's a bit like a "social fast food", and it has the same effect on our mental health as real fast food has on our bodies.

There are both positive and negative studies on social media use; but who's right now? The answer lies in the fact that a day, even between friends, is strictly 24 hours. And it is useless to have small positives from social media if it pushes you away from offline relationships, which have been proven by many to be much better.

We must therefore distinguish between connecting and talking! And again, this is absolutely not anti-technology... Just use everything in its place! And if texting, chatting and liking are now just about connecting - but we're building for conversation - then there's something to change. We're not as connected as we think we are. We don't need to. But the connections we do have that matter, let's not try to keep them that way! At first it will seem like a narrowing of our social network, but the withdrawal symptoms will soon subside. And then the real conversations can begin.




Concrete implementation tips:

Do not like!* This is the minimum, 1-bit information. Replacing our complex social skills with this is the biggest slap in the face to our brains.
?
It's not even like driving a Ferrari below the speed limit, it's more like towing a donkey tied behind a donkey.

Block your text message handling! Make "do not disturb" mode the default! Designate 1-2 short periods a day (email mode) where you check back on your notifications up to that point, respond, and then go back to "do not disturb" mode! The 2 main benefits are that 1) you can be more present when you're not messaging, and 2) the non-immediate replies and slightly more reserved availability means that neither of you will think this is a real conversation. Therefore, if you value the connection, you will make an effort towards real conversation, which will benefit you. If not, then the relationship will wear away; which will benefit you in the long run.

Have a telephone "open line"! The phone is a real conversation because it has an analogue signal - tone, pitch, volume, tempo, etc. However, distance makes it uncomfortable to call the other person when you don't know if you're going to be disturbed. It may therefore be worthwhile to set an "open time" in advance where anyone can call. They will know that they are not disturbing you, so they may call more often.

* A quick, self-aggrandizing, but still valid footnote: liking the blog's Facebook page is not exactly the kind of social activity the book preaches against. No one here thinks we're triggering quality communication with it. In fact, you're only helping me spread these ideas, which is good for everyone... So I'm making the exception valid: my stuff is allowed to be liked!

<br>














## <a name="leisure"></a>Reclaim leisure!

The disappearance of our digital habits doesn't cause serious inconvenience because we miss what we no longer have. Rather, the problem is that it confronts us with the existential vacuum that Frankl mentioned earlier, which we used to cover up much of our digital stuff. So if we don't fill the vacuum while - indeed, before! - minimise our digital attitudes, then change will be unsustainable.

And for some filling advice, it's worth looking at people who no longer need to work - and can therefore spend their days however they want. It may be surprising, but rarely will we see relaxation, idleness, or 'lounging' in a hammock stretched out between palm trees that has become symbolic. They feel good about themselves because they are working - only according to their own values, because there is no one to impose anything on them anymore. A guy called Bennett wrote a book about it (biased but evergreen in parts). He argues in it that the more energy you put into the 8 hours you work, the more energy you put into the 16 hours you are "free". That is: the value you get out of an activity is directly proportional to the effort you put into it. So prioritise challenging activity over consuming passivity!

Any self-fulfilment is satisfying. But the book argues strongly that this should happen in the physical world, not in the digital space. I would add: if not only, at least! By no means should we leave our two hands out of the fun entirely!

We can also take advantage of the interesting phenomenon that in certain social circles (board game cafes, coaching teams, volunteering), heightened emotions that would seem crazy in other contexts are normal and acceptable. Think of a shouting match in a line race... The point is that it should be a social programme with some kind of set of rules, internal cohesion, even its own language and culture. And the excitement created here gives you an experience that you wouldn't get in a 'normal' socialisation - especially not in front of a screen. So look for activities that require real-world, structured social interaction!

Of course, the author is still not saying that we should turn away from digital. But he does say that analogue is likely to be a much more rewarding experience. Digital minimalism therefore demands that we replace our primary sources of leisure with analogue. Besides, we can now safely use all sorts of digital aids to support them.


Concrete implementation tips:

Fix or build something every week! Instead of the handymen of old, nowadays everyone just pays. But manual work can not only be fun, it can also save you a lot of money.

Plan your "low-level" free time in advance! If you do a total cutback, the little inconveniences can easily cross the critical threshold where you can talk yourself out of the whole minimizing thing. From there, we fall back into excess in no time. But if we plan in advance when and how much time we can "just fuck up", this danger is not a threat.

Join something! It's almost certain that there is a club for all of us where we can better express ourselves. And if there isn't, there's nothing stopping us from starting one.

Let's make plans for "higher" leisure too! At GTD we have already talked about different horizons, complex planning and the recognition of the link between long-term results and current actions. Now, these could (should?) be applied not only in professional life. We should have about quarterly plans with specific goals and habits to maintain.

The overall lesson is that doing nothing is highly overrated! Doing something harder but more rewarding is always more worthwhile. We just need to get into the habit of actually doing something like this instead of mindlessly tapping away on the phone...

<br>











## <a name="resistance"></a>Join the attention resistance!

There's been a trend for some time that many media sources see their consumers not as customers, but as products that the publisher resells to advertisers. This has obviously taken off with the internet, but the real big breakthrough has been smartphones, because they have been able to grab previously unattainable attention spans. As things stand, the attention economy is worth more than oil!

To turn smartphones into this attention hoover, people had to be trained to look at their phones as much as possible. Hence all the psychological research on how to exploit our evolutionary weaknesses. And to maintain it, we need to stop thinking about what we're doing.

So let's rebel! Join the "resistance" and think of it all as a zero-sum game, where one wins as much as the other loses. If we give our attention, they benefit and we lose our autonomy. And we don't even have to give up digital services to change this balance of power. We should just use them with surgical precision and intentionality! For their own benefit, and at the expense of the attention market.

Concrete implementation tips:

Don't install social media apps on your phone! Do not install social media apps on our social networks. And since they bring big money to companies, they do. If you feel you really need one, use it from your browser! Because the need for a particular service may be defensible, but how can you need them on your phone? That's not defensible.

Let's change our devices to one feature! A lot of productive time can be saved if, for example, we can't browse the web when we "shouldn't". At first glance, it may seem strange that limiting a general-purpose tool can increase productivity - but it does. Of course, they really are good tools because they can do so many things. But not because you can do many things with them at the same time! If you write, you need a typewriter, if you read, you need an e-reader. So let's use blockers, bans, zen modes, and so on. And if you can't compromise, you might even want to consider a "dumb" phone. If that's the only way out, you're better off with a bunkphone than staying in the grip of your smartphone.

Open up to slow media! Consumption of information is also more efficient from a few quality sources rather than from the many "lukewarm puddles". Everyone has a voice online, but we should only be willing to give attention to those who can prove they deserve it. Let's have an elaborate method of how we inform ourselves! It doesn't necessarily have to be analogue - but let's not compulsively click through 5-10 websites several times a day!

<br>












## Summary

This book is not promoting anything extra, just practicality! It shows us who is grabbing our attention behind the scenes and what philosophy can pull us out of their clutches. If we master the principles and follow the advice, in time we will use all technology to serve us, not the other way around. It's not really about the technology itself, it's about getting our agenda more in line with our principles.

It is important to see that there is no anti-technology here! We are not rejecting innovation, but the way others use it. So let's leave everything that doesn't support our values, let's choose the best of everything, and let's even impose strict conditions of use on top of that! And doing so, after the initial difficulties, will undoubtedly lead to a more conscious, better quality of life.
