I'd like to turn back a bit from the lofty realm of abstract thoughts towards our concrete, ordinary, have-you-seen-my-left-shoe kind of world in this post. I mean, it's all well and good that we think about our principles, our dreams, our attitudes, and even the great overarching purpose of our lives, but if we then get lost in the minutiae of the day-to-day, none of it will matter. So I picked up [Getting Things Done](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22573850-getting-things-done){:target="_blank"} (or simply GTD) by David Allen, often referred to as *the* "productivity bible". And if this method has helped countless business leaders carrying huge burdens and responsibilities, it can probably make life more streamlined -- and less stressful -- for us mere mortals, too.

Speaking of "less stressful", the subtitle of the book (The Art of Stress-Free Productivity) promises that not only will we be more productive, but we will also become a lot calmer in the process! This is because if we always do what we know we *should* be doing, we won't have any cognitive dissonance, and we'll have that coveted [flow]({% post_url 2022-10-26-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi-flow %}) experience more easily. On top of that, the method is modular -- meaning, it doesn't require us to follow everything word for word -- so hopefully the habituation phase itself won't cause too much mental distress either. The author is well aware that we are not perfect, so he wants to help, not just add another thing to feel guilty about to the queue.

It was emphasized at the beginning that the book would be more about principles rather than a series of concrete steps. Now *this* hasn't really been fulfilled. As an illustration, the five-step planning method of chapter three is detailed step by step (after two counter-examples), and it was at the 4th element of a 6-long expansion list under the second subsection of the first step when it occurred to me that "Hansel and Gretel can suck it along with their breadcrumbs!".

> As to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.
>
> -- Ralph Waldo Emerson

This is not to say, of course, that there weren't useful principles in the book that could be applied universally. It just means that they needed a bit of extraction. There were many timeless, obsolescence-proof tips -- only they were demonstrated at a "granddaddy" modernity level, with pen and paper. I filtered these out, partly because they were incompatible with my digital fixation anyway. On the other hand, I dare to hope that you, my dear readers, will also be able to tailor the details to your own needs, knowing the principles.

The point is that there is nothing "new" or "revolutionary" about all this; it just states in concrete terms what we are already doing unspoken. But direct control through concreteness can bring very significant changes! Imagine pressing buttons randomly on a bare control panel, and then getting labels explaining what each button does.

Structurally, the book covers the same "curriculum" in 3 parts, with varying degrees of depth and detail. With your permission, I've condensed these passes into one, so that everything is touched on only once -- but then completely. I'll skip the project planning part on top of this, because I think focusing on how to deal with existing shitstorms is plenty to start with. So the table of contents became the following:

## <a name="intro"></a>Introduction

Nowadays it's almost inevitable -- even fashionable! -- to take on more than we can handle. This is accompanied by a blurring of the boundaries between work and leisure, especially in "knowledge-based" work. True, the information that could potentially improve any of our processes is in fact infinite and easily accessible. But then someone would have to access it, interpret it, draw conclusions... And if that weren't enough, even our work in general isn't well defined. In fact, we no longer have to adapt to our work, but to continuous adaptation itself.

If everything in our lives were "in order", meaning we'd have the same job, no financial or health crisis, no need to move or renovate, no children, etc. Then *maybe* we could slowly find a rhythm of our own that would make everyday life sustainable. But unfortunately, most of the time, both our work and personal lives are in a state of constant flux. The pace of life (culture, lifestyle, technology) has accelerated to the point where we have to make hugely consequential changes increasingly often. In fact, not much is different from what it used to be, just the tempo.

> Nothing is new, except how frequently it is.

This in turn leads to a situation where the old methods are no longer good enough, even if we happen to do the same things we used to. Today's speed and complexity is no longer covered by a simple `TODO` list. There is a surprisingly large number of things to deal with on an average daily basis, so a system is very important. But if we can consciously recognize how many things we have in our heads, and have a system for dealing with them, then it won't be such a huge mental burden to jump from one thing to the next.

It's a well-meaning attempt to define higher, more abstract goals, and then have the resulting value system guide our choices. But it can't quite cope with the distractions of the day-to-day, hour-to-hour level. The truth is, by default, no one is used to thinking about work. For a very long time, work was just something that wasn't done yet needed to be done. If we shoveled shit, we'd know exactly what needs to be done; we'd see how big the pile is, how much is left, and shovel on.

This "two brain cells" attitude won't get the job done anymore. And for the more abstract, less tangible life goals, it's never been enough in the first place. So even if it seems logical that our big vision should dictate the details, let's still build from the bottom up. Most of us are so lost in our daily lives that we have no chance to get to our vision. But if we prioritize the small implementation steps, we can at least start moving forward, even if "blindly" at first.

<br>

The solution proposed in this book can be summarized in 5 steps -- which will also be the subject of the next 5 sections:

1. We collect all the tasks -- giving us a definition of what it would mean to be "ready";

2. We make each item concrete -- giving us a definition of what it means to "do" each item;

3. We organize each item into multi-level, complex lists (depending on how we want to be reminded of them);

4. We use these lists to inform our self-analysis; and

5. We actually do what needs to be done.

If anything is rattling around in our heads, then we've failed already, because as a baseline, *nothing* should be rattling around there! So we collect, concretize and store things -- including what needs to be done, what the end goal is, and what the next step would be. Each repetition of this process will make us feel a little bit better, and we can multiply this feeling many times over if we make a habit out of it. The main thing is to get stuff out of our heads!

> There is usually an inverse relationship between how much something is on your mind and how much it's getting done.

Left to ourselves, we waste most of our energy thinking about the problem, not the solution. This pillar of "getting things out of our heads" works because it forces us to focus on the solution. Even though we are not making progress, we are making what progress would look like concrete, and that makes it clearer what needs to get done and why. The focus becomes the end goal and the way to get there, not wallowing in the problem.

> -- Bill Raeder

But don't worry, similarly to athletes, this can be improved! We're not progressing slowly because we're thinking slowly; we're just thinking "badly". And thankfully it's not our time, incoming information, or priorities that need to be managed, it's "just" our actions -- which we 100% *can* control.

My personal opinion is that it's not even the quality or the depth of the system itself that is really important, but that we A) have one, and B) trust it. There is little difference between a bad system and an optimal system. The big gap is between having one and not having one. So let's have some system so that we are prepared to go to war with ourselves.

<br>

A few words about preparation: the author holds regular consultations and the transition to his system is usually done as a crash course of about 2 full days. Obviously, in our case, there is no such formality, or hurry. However, we *should* be aware in advance that, as with anything new, a major effort is to be expected. We shouldn't let this put us off, though, as maintenance will be a breeze -- and in time, an automatic part of our daily routine. It's just about enduring until we get there.

A prerequisite is to have a decent office. If we work from home, then there. If we commute to work, then there **too**. If we're on the road a lot, we should still have a ready-made solution for what we can do in what contexts, what we have on hand when, that sort of thing. What any of us *actually* needs is, of course, very subjective. The main thing is to be able to manage lists somehow, and to have some kind of calendar. Besides, we don't share! Everyone needs their own workspace -- which doesn't have to be a whole separate room, but at least a separate desk.

The other key requirement is a universal filing system. Otherwise, we will soon turn our "saved" things into an amorphous pile. It should be quick, simple and always at hand, otherwise we won't use it. Also, we have to remember that we want to access data here, not just store it. A good rule of thumb is that if it takes longer than a minute to either file or retrieve anything, it's no good.

Armed with this information, we can finally get started on the 5 key steps to keep our lives under control.

<br>















## <a name="capturing"></a>Capturing
As soon as we label something as "must", "should" or "could", it becomes an "incomplete". Incomplete, because our brain knows that there is something we haven't done yet (but must, should or could). If we don't record this properly -- that is, outside of our heads, with a specific end goal, and a specific next step -- it will fester. And the rattling just keeps eating away at our attention!

Therefore, the first step towards stress-free living is to collect **everything** that grabs our attention. This can be in a physical inbox tray, on paper, via digital text/audio, email, whatever. What is essential is that:

- Everything is outside our heads;

- Everything is in the same place -- or, at the very least, in as few places as possible. If half of it is here while the other half is there, we won't trust either source (and rightly so);

- Every incoming item is regularly processed to keep the metaphorical "input tray" usable.

> You can only feel good about what you're not doing when you know everything you're not doing.

Spare nothing! If it requires any work on our part, let it come. If it's too big for the inbox, we should simply write a note about it and let *that* go in the inbox. It goes into the inbox even if it's already pre-organized -- it's much more important to keep everything uniform. If something is "just" misplaced, it *may* just go back in its place -- unless we have something to do with it, in which case (you guessed it) it goes in the fucking inbox! Once the physical stuff is done, a mental round is needed, of course. Whatever comes to mind, from stopping climate change to buying cat food on the way home.

It's important to note that we **don't** start organizing stuff here. This is just a collection of what we will have to deal with in the first place. And making decisions or categorizing requires a very different state of mind than collecting anyway. Let's also be aware, though, that nothing can stay at this stage for long. If our brains feel that we are not really dealing with the inputs, then the *rattling* comes back again!

Psychological outlook: collecting is both anxiously negative and liberatingly positive. But the negative part doesn't actually come from all the work we have to do -- because then it would never be over -- but from all the "agreements" we've made with yourself so far that we've broken. And if that's the case, then:

- Either we shouldn't take on so many commitments (which will be much easier to defend with a clear `TODO` list); or

- We just have to do it and that's it; or

- We need to renegotiate with ourselves.

If something is kept solely in our heads, it only knows present tense. As soon as we have two things in there, we are already breaking at least one of our vows because we are not doing one of them. That's why we have to keep everything out of your heads. This applies even to what at first sight might seem insignificant. In our minds, there is no difference between cleaning the basement and starting a business -- both are just vows.

Thinking **about** something is always more useful than thinking **of** it. Reminding should be the job of a system, so that we can always add value during our thinking.

It's very apparent in a relationship or in a company culture how reliable individual links are. If we have to hold someone's hand because otherwise we'd fear not getting what we asked for, there will be a constant dose of stress in the background. There can also be a proliferation of meetings, which wouldn't even be necessary if things were running smoothly. But if we trust the other person's system, we don't always need to demand immediate attention -- they can just respond when they get to it. In the author's family, for example, they even do it at home by dropping things into each other's inboxes instead of interrupting the other. Of course, all this doesn't mean that we're sailing in the right direction -- or that we're on the right boat at all... But at least we'll be sailing more efficiently!

<br>
















## <a name="clarifying"></a>Clarifying

Once our inboxes are bursting at the seams, it's time to flesh out which items are what and what to do with them. The first question is: what is it? Sounds funny, but in the author's experience, many people don't even get that far... But we should at least identify what we are "dealing with".

The second question is: do we have anything to do with it? Because it may well be that we don't. If we don't have it now, we incubate it (see under Systematisation). If we don't have it, but we want to keep it for reference, it can go into the file (which was a prerequisite). And if we don't even want to retrieve it, there's the bin for that. Goodbye!

And if we have to deal with it, the most important thing is, what exactly, physically, is the next step with it? So much so that "organising a meeting" is not precise enough. "Email XY about the meeting" is much better. The next action is not "we should decide"! Decision is quick and not a physical activity, so we should not push this part. If you need more info to make a decision, the next step could be "email XY for his opinion" or "brainstorming with a list of pros and cons" which will bring you closer to the decision. Be careful that the next actions are really atomic and concrete, otherwise they will revert to "stuff" and continue to carry uncertainty.

If the action thus planned cannot do the whole job on its own, it can be linked here to a project that brings together all the multiple steps in a task sequence. Once this is in place, we can again branch off in 3 directions: the task can be done, delegated or postponed.

If it's all less than 2 minutes, we can get it down and done. There's no scientific reason why exactly 2 minutes, it's just that there's a limit of efficiency at about where it's more worthwhile to do it rather than file it - and then there's nothing to file.
If it's longer, but we don't have to do it, someone else will do it. The method of delegation itself is up to your communication system, but it is important that we have a written record of it. Just because the other party forgets doesn't mean we should.
And if it is long and we have to do it, we will come back to it. Period.
To avoid any misunderstanding, once again: if it's not a 2-minute "quick way to get it off", it doesn't have to be done here! We just need to make the decision on what to do with it. Let's go through the inbox one by one, without prioritizing! It doesn't matter how important it is, because I'm just deciding its fate.

I'm like a mosquito in a nudist camp; I know what I want to do, I just don't know where to start.

- Stephen Bayne

At this point, we've dumped, filed, delegated, or in 2 minutes, we've got a good deal down. But we're left with a "in progress" pile of things to do. We'll deal with that in the Sorting section.

?
There are no interruptions - just mismanaged inputs.

Psychological insight: do not underestimate the power of the next action. Thinking ahead, and drawing conclusions already drawn, will allow us to exploit the odd small gap in our agenda. I might not have the energy to go to my inbox and untangle things at a given moment, but I might have the energy to do a mindless little to-do.

There is often a fog in our minds. It's so clear that we think we know what to do next. But it's so vague that we don't really know, so we're repelled and we avoid it. People with good imagination are said to delay more because they are the most vivid imaginers of the horror they are fleeing.

I am an old man and I have lived through many hardships, but most of them never happened.

- Mark Twain

It would be nice if we could tone down this "negative self-vizualization". Alcohol, for example, is no good because it dulls everything down. But the definition of the next action can have that effect! It's not even sure that the negative feelings were towards the to-do, but towards the slight insecurity and indecision.

Either way, we have to determine the next action at some point. But it makes a big difference whether we determine it when it first comes up or when it has already gone off the rails. In the latter case, we will be in constant fire-fighting mode and it will not be at all efficient to carry it out.

A predetermined next step gives a clear picture, and the responsible party can be accountable, productive and self-reliant. When you decide what you want to do, rather than being driven by external pressure, it is more rewarding than just suggesting to yourself how effective you are.

They also do away with complaining. If you can change the situation, then there is next action, and pay attention to it. If you can't, then you have to accept your inertia - which the lack of next action will force you to do.

All action has a price and risks, but they are far less than the long-term price and risks of comfortable inaction.

## <a name="organizing"></a>Organizing

Ok, we've collected, we've concretised, time to organise the rest! Our primary concern is to keep the boundaries between categories 'sharp'. All different kinds of conventions with ourselves that define when and how we ask for reminders. If these start to conflate, it all becomes meaningless.

In fact, you only have to manage lists, which may make many people sceptical, as many people have been writing lists for a very long time without success. But it is not "easy yet", it is "easy already"! In other words, a lot of brainstorming, organisation and experimentation has gone into getting the end user to write lists.

?
We must strive for simplicity beyond sophistication.

- John Gardner

The decisions of the concretisation step can put things in 8 places in total. If it's project related, our first stop is the project list and the references that can be linked to projects. The (1) project list is the home of any task that consists of several steps. It's a very loose condition, so it's likely that a lot of things will be "projects" that you didn't think of as such before. A project list is not a list of details, just a sort of "table of contents" that gives you a higher level of overall focus and frees up mental energy. Your current situation, your long-term plans, your values, or your problems can be starting points for exploring projects. It can be broken down into subcategories as needed, but all need to be given equal attention!

References that can be linked to project (2) may include any "supporting material". The point is that they should not serve as a reminder - there are other tools for that. This could also include ideas that are not forthcoming actions, but that we know in advance where they will go. Once everything has its well-defined place, we don't have to forget anything. You may want to integrate it with the general reference material, but then get it out and use it!

After project administration, we will move on to the next action defined in the previous step. If it was 2 minutes long, we didn't get that far in the first place. However, if we are here, let's have some trace of it! In the case of delegation, use the (3) queue to keep track of the responsibilities of others. It's worth dating it, because it can be very useful for tracing back.

When it is really left to us, we need to ask ourselves one more question: is the next action date-bound or "as soon as possible"? If it is date-based, then it can go in calendar (4). For efficiency, let us distinguish between dates and days. But the most important thing is not to treat our calendar as a TODO list! Only put in there what we have to do on that day/day and then consider them sacred and inviolable from then on. If we fill it with all sorts of "it would be nice to do this on that day" rubbish, then over time something will get missed and we will not respect our calendar enough.

And if it's (5) "as soon as possible", then put it on a TODO list. This can be a common place, or even categorised; you may want to organise these by context. For example, on the phone, at the computer, in town, at home, at the office, that sort of thing... This will help us make the most of unexpected little crumbs of time. Is the doctor late? In the meantime, I could make a phone call or two... if I had a list handy of who to call and why.

?
The first to complain about time shortages are those who make the worst use of their time.

- Jean de La Bruyère

We're done with the current to-do list, but relax, there are still three categories. If we just don't have it to do at the moment, but we might later, then we can have that incubation. These can also be time-sensitive things - for example, there's a concert next week, so don't forget to discuss at home at the weekend whether you want to go - and they can go in our calendar as well. But anything that's just in that "someday" or "maybe" category can go on a separate (6) parking list. You can think about your dreams, desires, even your current projects for inspiration. It's worth writing these out for yourself, because who knows, your subconscious might get to work and something might come of it.

If you don't have (foreseeable) things to do, but it would be nice to keep the current item as a reference, then... yep, you guessed it, it can go in the (7) references. If it's really been sorted out that we have nothing to do with this set, then it's okay to have a lot, it won't trigger the motosking! The sorting itself is a matter of individual taste, it's worth starting simple from the beginning and the system will "grow" with you.

And as a deduction, if you have nothing to do with it, and don't want to retrieve it, then (8) throw it in the bin. It may sound obvious, but it is very important not to mix it with anything else. If it's just one thing that we have to do with, we won't dare throw it away, so it will need to be re-sorted, become "stuff" and extra work. So as soon as we know something is rubbish, it goes in the bin.


## <a name="reflecting"></a>Reflecting

It's not enough to organise your tasks, you also need to review them from time to time. For example, it's one thing to know that you're out of milk, it's quite another to remember it in the shop. You can only think 'higher' if you can really leave the low level to the system, and you can only do that if the system is always 100% reliable. That's why you always need to keep it fresh, periodically review it, delete from it, expand it, etc. If you don't review your open threads for a very long time, your brain will gradually take back the role of reminder and the "mothballing" will return. So regular - daily and weekly - review is essential for the whole GTD to work!

?
Maintaining our lives and seeking happiness are not two different things.

- Ayn Rand

If everything is set up properly, a few seconds here and there a day can be enough. You need to look so much and so often that you are always sure you are doing what you should be doing. Obviously your calendar and TODO list provide the skeleton of your day, and usually that should be enough. But be flexible and keep the other lists handy, because you may need anything at any time.

The weekly review is more at the project level rather than the individual to-do list - it's worth building on the project list from the start. The main goal is to get to a state where you can confidently say "I am absolutely aware of everything I am not doing, but could do if I chose". Based on experience, 2-2 hours on Friday mornings is recommended, but everyone tailors it to their own needs. The point is to make it a quasi-ritual, because it will give you the mental clarity that will allow you to think more creatively about your longer-term plans.

To understand the world, we sometimes need to turn away from it.

- Albert Camus



## <a name="engaging"></a>Engaging
This is the part where we 'intervene' in the way the world works and actually do something. I hope no one thought we could get away with it! But what and how we intervene is very different. And if the first four steps get stuck anywhere, it will almost certainly not be where and how it should be.

The bad(ish) news is that, even if we've done everything right, we'll still have several options to choose from intuitively at most moments. The good news is that, because of our system, we may no longer just hope we can choose well, but trust it.

?
You should always be doing more than you can do, and you can only do one thing at a time. The key is to feel as good about the things you're not doing as you do about the things you are doing.

The book offers a 4-step system to help you decide in the "heat of the moment":

Context: if I'm at work, obviously get on with some work; or if I don't have my phone handy, I don't want to be on the phone all of a sudden;
time: it makes a difference whether I only have 5 minutes or 5 hours;
energy: am I dead or am I just starting fresh; and
priority: once you have filtered the options from the previous three, you can then prioritise the rest.
?
There is no time to think minute by minute and day by day. You need to be done thinking by then.

And to set our priorities - and manage our whole lives - it makes sense to look at our goals from different perspectives. The author suggests 6 horizons:

Level 1 (ground level): current tasks
Level 3: current projects
Level 2: areas and responsibilities
level 1: goals, what will/should be in 1-2 years
Level 3: vision, what will / should be in 3-5 years
Level 3: the "big picture", what is my purpose in life, what are my principles...
The challenge is to marry the high level, idealistic goals with the low level, mundane job.

?
The idealist says that the short distance doesn't matter. The cynic says the long distance doesn't matter. And the realist says it is what is done or not done in the short term that determines the long term.

- Sydney J. Harris

And here let me repeat a little of what I said in the introduction: it might seem logical to approach it from above, but in fact the reverse is true. You could say that the higher levels determine the lower levels, and why, for example, should I bother with a certain job if it turns out that I don't want that job... But as long as the lower levels are not in control, I don't get to the point of dealing with my higher motivations.

If you have a well-oiled, low-level method, it will work later on, whatever you use it for. Conversely, if you can flawlessly tease out your life's main goals, but you can't concretely implement them - because you simply never get there - then what's the point of it all?

If your ship is sinking, then you don't really care if it's on course!


## <a name="underpinnings"></a>Scientific underpinnings
This is about the end of the original book, but there has been a lot of interesting cognitive and social research since it was first published, which nicely supports the principles discussed in it.

Positive psychology is an initiative to stop focusing on the negative all the time. Happiness, mental wellbeing, meaning in life, and other little things are worth a sermon. Fortunately, there are more and more "formal" curricula for these too, and GTD can help. There are not "only" TODO lists here either, and mental clarity, right prioritization, happiness, success, etc. are goals - and consequences.

The field of distributed consciousness proclaims the value of an external brain. Its motto is "Your brain is for inventing ideas, not storing them". And if you don't have to remember, you'll find it much easier to think - because that's what your brain is for.

Research on the subject of cognitive load has shown that 'unfinished' threads do indeed belong here. And the good news is that they don't just disappear when they're done; they disappear when they're put into a reliable system.

The goal is also very similar for flow theory, and it's about all compatible. GTD actually only promotes the principles described there at a lower level.

The three strands of self-direction theory are also all related in some way. Managing our own behaviour can be matched by regular reminders; and exploiting our natural talents can be matched by, say, bagging small 'wins' by filling in small time slots.

Implementing intentions is based on the assumption that if you decide in advance when and what you will do to achieve a particular goal, you will have the strength and capacity to do it at that moment. And this is good because you don't have to "spend" your - very limited - willpower on it. Again, the tight system of GTD relates to this quite well.

Finally, the collective noun PsyCap is a combination of self-reliance, optimism, hopefulness (here: what the goal is and the paths to get there), and resilience. I suppose it will surprise no one when I say that GTD supports all of these:

You will be self-reliant because you always know what your responsibilities are and what you can do for them;
optimistic, because it teaches you that "you can do it if you put your mind to it", which will make you dare to do more and bigger things;
hopeful, because you identify your goals and several potential paths that will make it harder to get stuck; and
resilient because it gives you stability in the face of unforeseen - or even unforeseeable - difficulties and helps you keep your cool.

GTD is a lot like mastering an instrument or a sport: there's never an 'end', it's an art that can be perfected over a lifetime. But in return, like instruments and sports, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

At the basic level, we still pay attention one by one to the collection, the definition of next steps, the waiting lists, the TODO lists per person, a transparent and quick reference system, the stripped-down calendar, and the weekly review. All are easy to slip up with, even if they are not big things in themselves, but - precisely because they are not big things - they are just as easy to climb back up! It can take years for everything to sink to a routine level, but once you have it, it becomes a stable hour-by-hour, day-by-day level.

As an intermediate, the goal is more week-by-week or month-by-month. There will be a higher horizon of thinking and order, and in addition to our actions, we will have our projects and permanent responsibilities in order. By this time we have typically tailored and integrated the method into our own lifestyle to some extent. It's also a good sign that if something unexpected comes along, it's not that we're being pushed out of your system, but that we're seeking "refuge" in it.

As a master, the system is no longer the focus. And we can use the energies we release to deepen our interests and relationships, or add value with our outside brain. In the clear order, we can see connections that we might not otherwise see, and we can often benefit from the unexpected mixing of areas of our lives.

## Summary

GTD gives us a universally applicable set of tools that can be used to bring order to the messiest, most hectic mess. Obviously it won't replace discipline and work, but at least we won't slip through the cracks of lack of methodology while working in a disciplined way.

To sum up, rather than a mechanical repetition, I would highlight the lessons that are most important to me:

A big emphasis on writing things down. I've changed immeasurably since I stopped trying to keep everything in my head. Our minds are not equipped to deal with the complexities of today's world on their own. Let's write things down!

We are also given a concrete template for how to write things down, which makes the process easier to mechanise and thus reduces it to a routine level more quickly.

It's all about standardising what reminders we ask for of things and when. It was a big "ahaaa!" moment when this came down.

Also an important mental model was the part where she traced the stress of to-do lists back to broken vows to ourselves. To solve our problems, we should first see them clearly.

Finally, I would bring up the 'bottom-up' attitude mentioned several times, because it points to a very important truth. If you don't have your agenda in order at a low level, it doesn't matter what your big goals are, because you're never going to get there. Get yourself together first, and then the world will change!
