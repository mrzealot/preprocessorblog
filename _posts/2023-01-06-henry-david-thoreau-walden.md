My shorter-term plan is to cover all the topics mentioned in the introductory post at least tangentially, but for now we have focused pretty much exclusively on the mind. I could say that the blog is literally head heavy! So, starting with this mini-jubilee - my 10th post!!! - I'm going to turn a little more towards the physical world for a while, where we can dissect our bodies and our environment.

I'm particularly close to my heart with a minimalist philosophy of life, so I've chosen to focus on that for this week within the material world. And as Marcus Aurelius says, "go straight to the source of intelligence". So I'll start my exploration with Henry David Thoreau's Walden, which can be said to be one of the founding volumes of minimalism.

Thoreau was an American writer and philosopher who had a rather low opinion of the consumer society that was developing among his contemporaries; instead, he advocated a life close to nature, minimalist and independent. And before you think he was all talk: to illustrate his principles, in the mid-1800s he simply took to the woods and moved into a self-built cabin. In his book, he shares with the public the train of thought, his experiences and his conclusions that led him to this point.

The beginning of the book is packed with witty insights and quotable golden spittoons. By the end, he pulls the threads together neatly so that the main lessons are more profound. But the middle is a bit... how shall I put it... dull? There are a few gems in there - which I've scratched out, of course - but the bulk of it is landscape description and detailed descriptions of animals and plants. We move nicely around the seasons that change from one to the other; colours, sounds, smells... I would pass these over for lack of space (and interest). If you want something like this, read the original; or better yet, get out there!

But for those who stay, be prepared for a convincing argument for minimalist living, mixed with a good deal of social criticism!

## Economy

This is the part where he practically trashes people for living so shabbily - mainly because of their own delusions. They over-extend themselves, chasing money until they are sick, so that they have money saved for when they are sick. They think life is 'just like that', accept the default and suffer in silence. And it's not other people's opinions that are the problem, it's that theirs are the problem...

?
The 12 trials of Hercules are dwarfed by the ones my neighbours have taken upon themselves; because at least there were only 12 of them, which will end once they are over.

?
They are living the life of a fool, which they will find out in the end, if not before.

?
The majority of people live in quiet desperation.

The elderly try to share their wisdom about the great things in life, but if they are not happy, on what basis? Just because they've been living like crap for longer doesn't give them the right to reason. All ages like to think they have exhausted the possibilities of human existence, but so far none of them have succeeded... So let's just try to find a better balance!

To do this, we should first know what is really necessary. Because we can only contemplate the higher meaning if we are not always busy chasing things that are not necessary. The first approximation is four elements: food, shelter, fuel and clothing. And while they do cover the necessities, on closer inspection even these can be grouped under one label: warmth. The essence of our physical needs is simply to maintain the warmth of life. To do this, we need food on the inside (and perhaps the fire to cook it), and shelter, fire, and clothing on the outside. And then we can legitimately ask: if all we need is to stay warm, what's the big fuss about?

Even the luxury and comfort of it all can only get in the way of what's really important. The majority of the "big ones inside" were not by accident poor on the outside by choice. But nowadays, unfortunately, there are no philosophers any more, only philosophy professors. And we should not only know, but also do - solve the problems of human life practically, not just theoretically.

We do not, of course, criticise someone who is rich, even though he is not poor in spirit. Or who is content with his lot and just minds his own business. The problem is with the (most populous) class who are constantly complaining about how bad it is for them - but they are 'doing their duty'! Or they are rich but just forging their own golden chain!

Our hero, by contrast, is on a completely different path. He has always loved and walked in nature, watched the paths, the plants, been a forest ranger to some extent. Of course, no one was interested in this or recognised his work - especially financially. But the lack of recognition did not lead to the realisation that he should do something else or learn to sell himself better! Rather, it led to a realisation of how to avoid the need to sell at all. Living on less, more simply!


So he decided to take it upon himself to move out into the forest. Her clothes were a stiff, ordinary set, which she patched rather than changed. And there's firewood in the woods. So all he really needed, apart from food, was shelter. Some people can get by in colder climates without it, in a sleeping bag - and in warmer climates it's unnecessary. But it does help to get through winter and rainy weather. So he set to work with his hands (and borrowed tools).

Here too, however, we must think strictly in terms of necessities! A few square feet of railroad tool box "box" might do the trick, a few dollars, and then no rent. The tents of the Indians prove that it can be done naturally. The "savage" owns his "house" because it is so cheap and easy to do so. Meanwhile, the "civilized" man can mostly just rent his, and often can't even afford to do the math.

?
Most people never think about what a "house" is really for, and then spend their whole lives under unnecessary pressure to make theirs like their neighbour's.

The author, for example, could hardly name 3 out of 100 people in his village who don't have a loan on their farm. But maybe that's why they 'sold their souls' in a different way. He also describes a settler culture where they just dug their houses into the ground because the crops were suddenly more important that year. And okay, from this we can see that if there is more important, we can get by with much simpler dwellings. But don't we think that there is more important anyway? Our peace of mind, our loftier human goals, our "enlightenment" are always floating around... We just don't realise what a burden of material and effort we are taking on - and what we are missing out on because of it.

?
I'd rather sit alone on a pumpkin than cower on a velvet cushion with others.

Apparently there was a lot of progress even then, but where to? If we're not going in the right direction, it doesn't really matter that we're getting there faster now. And anyway, if you factor in the fare, then speed is no longer a certainty either. While others are working for the price of their tickets, we could easily walk there. In general, this whole "I work now so I can live the way I want afterwards" thing is seen as weird. If you want to be a poet, spend! And since it's partly for such considerations that this blog is written "now", you could say I tend to agree.

Thoreau worked just enough to meet his needs. And that was done very quickly because of the minimal requirements, so there was time for what was important. How much better if we wanted intellectual development as a legacy rather than luxury...

?
Nations are obsessed with impressing posterity with the amount of 'hammered stone' they leave behind. What if they cared as much about polishing their manners? An intelligent thought would be more memorable than a monument to the moon.

Given the above statements, abstract thinking is not enough, so we'll get into the details. For example, there comes a concrete account of how much he lived on. Where the numbers themselves don't tell the uninitiated eye much, but if you believe the author, it's very little - and I'm inclined to believe. Just basic groceries, plus what he produces. And with a house, clothes, and forest fire, we're done.

Thoreau's basic philosophy is very different in that he no longer (finally) looks at the positive side of everything. Sure, there could be more, but what do you have to give in return? Is it worth it anyway? For him, freedom is worth much more than material comfort.

?
The price of every object is the part of our life we have to give in return.

By working for about 6 weeks, or six weeks, he created enough money for his annual needs. He taught for a while, but it took a much bigger investment. And because he did it for money, not just for the benefit of his peers, he experienced it as a failure. He despised commerce, and besides: it takes a lot of work, and there is no sharp 'end' to it. So he worked a day job, of which the 6 weeks were enough. For him, making a living was more of a hobby.

?
My greatest skill is to want for little.

Now, when you hear figures like that, many people will probably say "what a cheeky assumption, this is not the world we live in today, phew"! But I hope the lesson still goes through: even if the absolute figures are wrong, we could still work proportionally less if we wanted to. And let's face it, we could want a lot less... But that's not cool, because today we really don't live in that kind of world anymore!

## A valuable life

By coincidence, Thoreau moved into his cabin in the woods on the 4th of July - Independence Day. It wasn't even ready for winter at the time, it was just sheltering from the rain, but that didn't cause any disruption. He felt about as isolated and remote there as if he was in another corner of the universe - but of course he says all this in an absolutely positive way.

Every morning he got up early and bathed in the lake. Another source who says that the source of all superiority is most clearly available in the morning. He claims that if some mechanical device is just pushing you out of bed instead of your inner Genie excitedly welcoming the new day, there's trouble. I, of course, immediately associated this with a modern version:

?
There is nothing wrong with Mondays. Your life is shit.

- Ricky Gervais

Under these circumstances, he could finally live a valuable, intellectual life.

?
Millions are awake for physical work; but only one in a million is awake enough to make an effective intellectual effort.

It's nice to paint or carve, of course, but it would be even nicer if we could change our own attitudes. Which we could, but so few of us do. Well, Thoreau did! He deliberately stripped his life down so that he could really only live what he had to live. His most famous quote - which became a catchphrase in the film Dead Poets Society - is related to this:

?
I went out into the wilderness because I wanted to live consciously. I wanted to fully absorb the essence of life. I wanted to destroy everything that was not Life, so that I would not realise at the hour of my death that I had not lived.

The words "Simplicity! Simplicity! Simplicity!", which is the most succinct way to sum up the whole book. If we were concerned with our lives, it is true that there would be no one who would build a railway... But there would be very few who would want to travel by rail. The fact that we are building railways in spite of this shows that we prefer to be 'travelled' by railways...

Let us also realise that 99% of the "news" is just gossip, which strictly speaking does not concern us. Or at least it shouldn't affect us. Let's read books instead, where we could make huge progress on the shoulders of "giants"! And the current forest conditions were much more suitable for serious reading than even a university.

?
How many lives have been opened up to a new era by reading a book!

?
The unspeakable at present can be found somewhere unspoken. The same questions that confuse us have confused every wise man who has ever lived. Without exception. And they all answered them, according to their abilities, with their words and their lives.

It takes practically a lifetime to learn... Take the time to read! A speaker can address an audience eloquently, but a writer's audience is the whole of humanity. Even those who are not there, or who have not even been born yet! This knowledge does not reassure me as I write this.

It is worth dealing with the classics first, because they are the only ones that have stood the test of time! Just because it's newer doesn't make it any better. The author makes many points about the lack of translation and popular dissemination of the old greats. This is much better today, technically, but unfortunately not popularly.

And it is the heavy reading that makes it worthwhile! Reading the 600th story about the same great love story, but with different names, is not 'real' reading. But we do stop at such things, and therefore our discussions are quite shamefully low level.

?
I don't make too much distinction between those who are really illiterate and those who can read, but only read literature for children or the weak-minded.

<br>


















## The middle bit

As I said, the middle will be a bit more scattered, because I had to scrape together the relevant stuff from here and there. Consider this section the best of the middle 200 or so pages:

It talks a lot about the trains running nearby and how they force people to be on time. This is where the big rush we are experiencing today was already beginning.

He had no neighbours within a mile, only trees around him and the lake on whose shore he settled. With that power he could have been anywhere, he was so "left alone".

?
As if I had my own sun and moon and stars; a little world just for me.

Everyone makes their home where the resources they need to live are close by. For those for whom it is the human companionship, the shop or the bar, they obviously remain villagers. But for those who like nature, they go out into nature. And so leaving people behind is not a "sacrifice" that "I wonder how he stands it!".

Loneliness is not measured by how far you are from the nearest person. You can be alone in a large group, but you don't have to be lonely on your own if you're busy. What many people don't understand is that if you're not doing a physical job, you can be busy at home, alone, in your head.

?
I think it's good to be alone most of the time. Company, even the best company, can get tiring very quickly. I like being alone. I have never found companionship as good as solitude.

I had 3 chairs: 1 for solitude, 2 for friendship, and 3 for companionship. There was for having as many as 30 people over and still fit. This also shows that the majority of our houses are much bigger than they need to be. And if more space was needed for larger conversations to "properly" unfold, there was the whole forest as a back room.

He had a woodcutter mate who he describes as a very 'one-off'. Very much an adult physically, but barely a child intellectually. I think this is worth mentioning because it reminded me of the way most people are educated today: just enough to know their place and their business.

A nice thought about why there was no lock on his door:

?
I am convinced that if others lived as simply as I do, 'robbery' and 'burglary' would be unknown concepts. They happen where some people have more than they should and others don't have enough.

As one leans more and more towards the moral, philosophical life, one moves away from the pursuit of physical pleasures, such as food. Nothing shows the rarity of the moral life better than the fact that whole nations are stuck in the larval period of gorging. It is not the quantity or quality of food that is the main issue, but our attitude. If we want to feed not only our bodies - so that we can live a moral life - but our appetites and tastes are the leading stimulus... Now that's the problem.

We all have the "animal" in us that is awake about as much as the higher consciousness is asleep.

A little Stoic philosophy repetition, free after Marcus Aurelius:

?
By thinking we can achieve to be sane outside ourselves. By conscious effort, our mind can separate itself from our actions and their consequences; and then all things, good and bad, just flow past us.

It also responds beautifully to the (apparent!) inconsistencies that arise when measuring the depth of the pond. Where some estimate fails, it is not because we have found a contradiction in natural law. All we have found is that there are things we don't yet understand.

<br>



















## A strong finish

We set most of the limits ourselves. Let's try to "stretch" our lives! And that doesn't necessarily mean chasing giraffes in Africa...

?
Point your gaze inwards and you will find thousands of regions in your mind that are still uncharted. Travel them and become an expert on your own home cosmography.

It may sound strange, but for many it is easier to travel the world thousands of miles, cold and hungry, than to look in the mirror. Escaping from themselves even makes it easier for some people to go to war, if they are not forced to clean up their own house in return.

?
Only the defeated and deserters go to war; cowards who run away and enlist.

It is often asked how far modern man is intellectually behind the more ancient civilisations, or even those of a few hundred years ago. But what are we getting at by complaining?

?
A live dog is better than a dead lion.

Let's stop crying about being dogs... let's be the best dogs we can be! And if we're determined enough to go after our goals, we can achieve successes we never imagined.

Try to see what is; not what we think we have.

?
However difficult your life may be [...] it is not as bad as you are.

?
The fault-finder will find fault even in heaven.

Let us strive for simplicity and minimalism! Let us pare down our lives so that the essential can play a greater role!

?
Cultivate your poverty like a garden herb.

?
With excess wealth you can only buy unnecessary things.

And by the way, we are even preaching ignorance, which is a cornerstone of Sapiens. Let us not be content with the status quo! Let us not think that we know or have seen everything, and so we just celebrate and congratulate ourselves! Let us stay alert, watch, learn and keep improving!

?
Only the day we are awake is the day we wake up.

<br>









## Summary

We have seen that a happy and fulfilling life does not need as much "stuff" as we might first think. But I would ask everyone to try to concentrate on the principle of what we are saying, rather than on the concrete implementation! It would be easy, because of Thoreau's extreme fanaticism, to brand the whole minimalism as stupidity; and that would be a big mistake.

Let us think of it as a call to awareness, where we can also - a little violently - question the 'baked-in' parts of our world view. Do I need the latest smartphone? How much life energy am I burning for those few days in the Seychelles? Do I replace my car because it's already replacement-ready - or just because it's new for the neighbour? Do I even need a car?

So it's not a case of foregoing electricity and tap water and heading for the forest. But we're probably far enough away on the other side of this horse that we're now on fire...
